This plant attracts stink bugs, primarily Chinese ones. (Halyomorpha halys)
Abutilon theophrasti (Velvetleaf, China Jute, Buttonweed, Butterprint or Indian Mallow) is an annual plant in the family ../Malvaceae/, native to southern Asia. It is encountered as a weed in many other parts of the world.
It grows to 1 m tall, and has velvet-like, heart-shaped leaves 15–25 cm broad. The flowers are yellow, 4 cm diameter, maturing into button-shaped seed pods.
Velvetleaf grows primarily in cropland, especially maize fields, and it can also be found on roadsides and in gardens . Velvetleaf prefers rich and cultivated soils.
After being introduced to North America in the 1700s, velvetleaf has become an invasive species in agricultural regions of the eastern and midwestern United States. It is one of the most detrimental weeds to corn, costing hundreds of millions of dollars per year in control and damage. Velvetleaf is an extremely competitive plant, so much so that it can steal nutrients and water away from crops.
Velvetleaf has been grown in China since around 2000 BCE for its strong, jute-like fiber. The seeds are eaten in China and Kashmir .
Paperbark Maple ("Acer griseum") is a species of maple native to central China. It was introduced to cultivation in Europe in 1901 by Ernest Henry Wilson for Veitch Nurseries, and to North America shortly after. The tree grows very slowly, so if being planted as a shade tree, large stock should be used.
It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree, reaching 10-18 m tall, and has smooth, shiny orange-red bark, which peels in thin, papery layers (mature bark is platy and brightly metallic-copper in color). The leaves are compound, with three leaflets, each 4-10 cm long and 2-6 cm broad, dark green above, bright glaucous blue-green beneath. The petioles and young stems are pubescent. The flowers are produced in small corymbs in spring, the fruit being a pair of winged samaras with the seeds about 1 cm long and a 3 cm wing. Young trees are upright, eventually developing a rounded habit.
Emerging foliage is copper-colored, fall color is bright red, in late season.
Some specimens will produce prolific seedlings in the garden, but due to the slow growth it is unlikely to become invasive.
Paperbark Maple is widely grown as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. It is admired for its decorative exfoliating bark, translucent pieces of which stay attached to the branches until worn away. It also has spectacular autumn color which can include red, orange and pink tones.
Deep, well-drained soils are recommended, as unlike many other maples its roots run well below the surface.
Recent attempts have been made to acquire new seed stock from wild populations in China because it is believed that the current gene pool of cultivated specimens is very small. Propagation of "Acer griseum" is somewhat difficult as seeds have parthenocaptic tendencies.
Pest and disease issues are rare in the garden. See ../Acer/ for a discussion of pest and disease problems affecting maples in general.
Due to the slow growth of seedlings, nursery stock often has problems with wrapping roots, which can lead to girdling later on if not addressed early.
Acer negundo is a species of maple ("Acer") that grows throughout much of North America. It is called Manitoba Maple in Canada, and Ash-leaved Maple (also Ashleaf Maple, Ash Maple) or Box Elder (also Boxelder, California Boxelder, Western Boxelder, Inland Boxelder, Boxelder Maple) in the United States. The American common names come from the pinnately compound leaves of "Acer negundo" that are similar to those on the elder ("Sambucus") and some species of ash ("Fraxinus"). The "box" in the name is thought to be because this maple's wood superficially resembles that of the box hedge ("../Buxus sempervirens/"). Additional common names include Cut-leaved Maple (because of the compound, or fully dissected, leaves), or Three-leaved Maple (because all new leaves from overwintering buds have 3 leaflets), or Sugar Ash (because the leaves resemble the ash, but it is a source of maple syrup). Its numerous and diverse common names attest to its familiarity to many peoples over a great geographic range.
This maple is a small, usually fairly short-lived tree that grows up to 10–20 m tall, with a trunk diameter of 30–50 cm, rarely up to 1 m diameter. The shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet wax coating when young. Unlike most other maples (which usually have palmate leaves), it has pinnate leaves with usually five (sometimes three or seven) leaflets, resembling an ash or an elderberry, hence the two alternative common names; the leaves are 12–25 cm long, with each leaflet 6–10 cm long and 3–7 cm wide. No other maple ever has more than three leaflets. The leaves have large serrations and are inequalateral at the base of the leaf. Twigs under one year old appear purple or green with a smooth whitish bloom. The flowers are small, lacking petals, borne in clusters of 10-30 together on drooping racemes 10–20 cm long, produced in early spring. The seeds are paired samaras, each seed slender, 1–2 cm long, with a 2–3 cm incurved wing; they are wind-dispersed and drop in autumn, or may persist through winter. Unlike most other maples, the tree is dioecious, so each tree grows only one gender of flower and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.
A few botanists treat it in its own distinct genus, as "Negundo aceroides", but this is not widely followed.
There are two subspecies:
The species is invasive under some conditions, and can quickly colonize abandoned farmland, old roadways, and uncultivated fence lines, both rural and urban. The range is therefore expanding.
This species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on floodplains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as riparian habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots. Although native to North America, it is considered to be an invasive species in some areas of the continent.
Several birds and some squirrels feed on the seeds; notably the Evening Grosbeak uses them extensively. The Boxelder Bug (also known as Maple bug) lays its eggs on all maples, but prefers this species.
"Acer negundo" is rarely planted as a landscape tree; its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding make it a poor choice for most areas. It often is found in landscapes in some areas due to it reproducing from the many seeds produced.
There are some cultivars, including some variegated forms, that are available in the nursery trade.
Although its wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fibre, for use in fiberboard.
Acer platanoides (Norway Maple) is a species of maple native to eastern and central Europe and southwest Asia, from France east to Russia, north to southern Scandinavia and southeast to northern Iran. It is widely cultivated elsewhere, and is also an invasive in some areas.
It is a deciduous tree growing to 20–30 m tall with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter, and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey-brown and shallowly grooved; unlike many other maples, mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark. The shoots are green at first, soon becoming pale brown; the winter buds are shiny red-brown. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed with five lobes, 7–14 cm long and 8–20 cm (rarely 25 cm) across; the lobes each bear one to three side teeth, and an otherwise smooth margin. The leaf petiole is 8–20 cm long, and secretes a milky juice when broken. The autumn colour is usually yellow, occasionally orange-red. The flowers are in corymbs of 15–30 together, yellow to yellow-green with five sepals and five petals 3–4 mm long; flowering occurs in early spring before the new leaves emerge. The fruit is a double samara with two winged seeds, the seeds are disc-shaped, strongly flattened, 10–15 mm across and 3 mm thick. The wings are 3–5 cm long, widely spread, approaching a 180° angle. It typically produces a large quantity of viable seeds. It is not particularly long-lived, with a maximum age of around 250 years.
Norway Maple is a member (and is the type species) of the section "Platanoidea" Pax, characterised by flattened, disc-shaped seeds and the shoots and leaves containing milky sap. Other related species in this section incluse "../Acer campestre/" (Field Maple), "../Acer cappadocicum/" (Cappadocian Maple), "../Acer lobelii/" (Lobel's Maple), and "../Acer truncatum/" (Shandong Maple). From Field Maple, Norway Maple is distinguished by its larger leaves with pointed, not blunt, lobes, and from the other species by the presence of one or more teeth on all of the lobes.
It is also frequently confused with the more distantly related "../Acer saccharum/" (Sugar Maple). Sugar Maple is easy to distinguish from this species by the clear sap in the petiole (Norway Maple has white sap in the petiole). The tips of the points on Norway Maple leaves reduce to a fine "hair", while the tips of the points on Sugar Maple leaves are on close inspection rounded. On mature trees, Sugar Maple bark is more shaggy, while Norway Maple bark has small, often criss-crossing grooves. While the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all Maple species, the leaf lobes of Norway Maple tend to have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on Sugar Maples. The seeds of Sugar Maple are globose, while Norway Maple seeds are flattened. Sugar Maple usually has a brighter orange autumn colour.
Many cultivars have been selected, with distinctive leaf shape or coloration such as the dark purple of 'Crimson King' and 'Schwedleri', the variegated leaves of 'Drummondii' and 'Emerald Queen', and the deeply divided, feathery leaves of 'Dissectum' and 'Lorbergii'. The purple-foliage cultivars have orange to red autumn colour. 'Columnare' is selected for its narrow upright growth.
The wood is hard, yellowish-white to pale reddish, with the heartwood not distinct; it is used for furniture and turnery.
It has been widely introduced into cultivation in other areas, including western Europe northwest of its native range. It grows north of the Arctic Circle at Tromsø, Norway. In North America, it is grown as a street and shade tree. It is favoured due to its tolerance of poor, compacted soils and urban pollution. As a result of these characteristics, Norway Maple is displacing locally native hardwoods in some parts of North America and is considered invasive in some states, but is still widely used for urban plantings in many areas. Norway Maple itself is threatened in a few areas by the ../Asian long-horned beetle/, which eats through the trunk of trees, often killing them.
Bad crotching can be an issue, and since the wood is relatively weak the tree can easily split in windstorms.
Cultivars are propagated by cutting or grafting, otherwise the tree produces abundant fertile seed.
Norway Maple is generally free of serious diseases, though can be attacked by the powdery mildew "../Uncinula bicornis//", and verticillium wilt disease caused by "../Verticillium/" spp.
Acer saccharum (Sugar Maple) is a species of maple native to the hardwood forests of northeastern North America, from Nova Scotia west to southern Ontario, and south to Georgia and Texas.
It is a deciduous tree normally reaching heights of 25–35 m tall, and exceptionally up to 45 m (150 feet). The leaves are deciduous, 8–15 cm long and equally wide with five palmate lobes. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the Silver Maple, however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow through orange to fluorescent red-orange. The leaf buds are pointy and brown colored. The recent years growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown.
The flowers are in corymbs of 5-10 together, yellow-green and without petals; flowering occurs in early spring after 30-55 growing degree days. The fruit is a double samara with two winged seeds, the seeds are globose, 7–10 mm diameter, the wing 2–3 cm long. The seeds fall from the tree in autumn.
It is closely related to the Black Maple, which is sometimes included in this species but sometimes separated as Acer nigrum. The western American Bigtooth Maple (Acer grandidentatum) is also treated as a variety or subspecies of Sugar Maple by some botanists.
The Sugar Maple is also often confused with the Norway Maple, though they are not closely related within the genus. The Sugar Maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf petiole (the Norway Maple has white sap), brown sharp-tipped buds (the Norway Maple has blunt green or reddish purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway Maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the Sugar Maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway Maple.
The Sugar Maple is an immensely important species to the ecology of many forests in North America. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of many forest types. It often forms associations with the American Beech, forming the beech-maple forest type, common in northern areas. Other associations include Sugar Maple-Yellow Birch (which is most important beyond the northern limit of beech), Sugar Maple-American Basswood, Sugar Maple-White Ash and Sugar Maple-Ironwood-Red Oak. Sugar Maples engage in hydraulic lift, drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself but also many other plants growing around it.
Sugar Maple is among the most shade tolerant of large deciduous trees. Among North American maples its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the Striped Maple, a smaller tree. Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. The sugar maple can grow comfortably in any type of soil, except sand.
Human influences have contributed to the decline of the Sugar Maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. The Sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. Acid rain and soil acidification are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads has decimated the sugar maple's role as a "street-front" tree.
In some parts of eastern North America, particularly near urbanized areas, the Sugar Maple is being displaced by the Norway Maple. The Norway Maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions resulting in the Sugar Maple's replacement in those areas heavily disturbed by human activities.
The sugar maple is widespread, and is considered secure, except at the edges of its range.
The Sugar Maple is one of the most important Canadian trees, being (with Black Maple) the major source of sap for making maple syrup; Sugar Maple being regarded as slightly better. Many maples can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but none of the others are as good as these two.
The wood is one of the hardest of the maples, and is prized for furniture and flooring. Bowling alleys and bowling pins are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple. Trees with wavy wood grain, which can occur in curly, quilted and "birdseye maple" form, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for basketball courts, including the floors used by the NBA, and it is a popular wood for baseball bats, along with white ash.
The Sugar Maple is a favorite street and garden tree, because it is easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color; however, its intolerance of pollution and compacted soils common to inner city conditions make it a frequent victim of maple decline. It also has some of the most dense shade to be found in shade trees. The shade and the shallow, fibrous roots may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep well-drained loam is the best rooting medium, although Sugar Maple can grow well on sandy soil which does not become excessively dry. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support Sugar Maple. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats. Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to boron.
Sugar Maple is the State Tree of New York, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
Achillea millefolium or Yarrow (other common names Common Yarrow, Gordaldo, Nosebleed plant, Old Man's Pepper, Sanguinary, Milfoil, Soldier's Woundwort, Thousand-leaf (as its binomial name affirms), Thousand-seal) is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to the Northern Hemisphere. 
Common Yarrow is an erect herbaceous perennial plant that produces one to several stems (0.2 to 1m tall) and has a rhizomatous growth form. Leaves are evenly distributed along the stem, with the leaves near the middle and bottom of the stem being the largest. The leaves have varying degrees of hairiness (pubescence). The leaves are 5-20 cm long, bipinnate or tripinnate, almost feathery, and arranged spirally on the stems. The leaves are cauline and more or less clasping. The inflorescence has 4 to 9 phyllaries and contains ray and disk flowers which are white to pink. There are generally 3 to 8 ray flowers that are ovate to round. Disk flowers range from 15 to 40. The inflorescence is produced in a flat-topped cluster. Yarrow grows up to 3500m above sea level. The plant commonly flowers from May through June, and is a frequent component in butterfly gardens. Common yarrow is frequently found in the mildly disturbed soil of grasslands and open forests. Active growth occurs in the spring.
Common yarrow is a drought tolerant species of which there are several different ornamental cultivars. Seeds require light for germination, so optimal germination occurs when planted no deeper than ¼ inch. Seeds also require a temperature of 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Common yarrow responds best to soil that is poorly developed and well drained. The plant has a relatively short life, but may be prolonged by dividing the plant every other year, and planting 12 to 18 inches apart. Common yarrow is a weedy species and can become invasive. It may suffer from mildew or root rot if not planted in well-drained soil.
There are several varieties and subspecies:
Yarrows can be planted to combat soil erosion due to the plant's resistance to drought.
The herb is purported to be a diaphoretic, astringent, tonic, stimulant and mild aromatic. It contains isovaleric acid, salicylic acid, asparagin, sterols, flavonoids, bitters, tannins, and coumarins. The plant also has a long history as a powerful 'healing herb' used topically for wounds, cuts and abrasions. The genus name "Achillea" is derived from mythical Greek character, Achilles, who reportedly carried it with his army to treat battle wounds. This medicinal action is also reflected in some of the common names mentioned below, such as Staunchweed and Soldier's Woundwort.
Yarrow has also been used as a food, and was very popular as a vegetable in the 17th century. The younger leaves are said to be a pleasant leaf vegetable when cooked as spinach, or in a soup. Yarrow is sweet with a slight bitter taste.
Yarrow has seen historical use as a medicine, mainly because of its astringent effects. Decoctions have been used to treat inflammations such as piles (hemorrhoids), and also headaches. Confusingly, it has been said to both stop bleeding and promote it. Infusions of Yarrow, taken either internally or externally, are said to speed recovery from severe bruising. The most medicinally active part of the plant are the flowering tops. They also have a mild stimulant effect, and have been used as a snuff. Today, yarrow is valued mainly for its action in colds and influenza, and also for its effect on the circulatory, digestive, and urinary systems.
The flowers, rich in chemicals are converted by steam into anti-allergenic compounds. The flowers are used for various allergic mucus problems, including hay fever. Harvest during summer and autumn. Drink the infused flower for upper respiratory phlegm or use externally as a wash for eczema. Inhale for hay fever and mild asthma, use fresh in boiling water. 
The dark blue essential oil, extracted by steam distillation of the flowers, is generally used as an anti-inflammatory or in chest rubs for colds and influenza. Massage oil for inflamed joints, dilute 5-10 drops yarrow oil in 25 ml infused St. John's wort oil. A chest rub can be made for chesty colds and influenza, combine with eucalyptus, peppermint, hyssop, or thyme oils, diluting a total of 20 drops of oil in 25 ml almond or sunflower oil.
The aerial parts are used for phlegm conditions, as a bitter digestive tonic to encourage bile flow, and as a diuretic. The aerial parts act as a tonic for the blood, stimulate the circulation, and can be used for high blood pressure. Also useful in menstrual disorders, and as an effective sweating remedy to bring down fevers. Harvest during flowering. The tincture is used for urinary disorders or menstrual problems. Prescribed for cardiovascular complaints. Soak a pad in an infusion or dilute tincture to soothe varicose veins.
Yarrow intensifies the medicinal action of other herbs taken with it, and helps eliminate toxins from the body. It is reported to be associated with the treatment of the following ailments:
Amenorrhea, anti-inflammatory, bowels, bleeding, blood clots, blood pressure (lowers), blood purifier, blood vessels (tones), Catarrh (acute, repertory), colds, chicken pox, circulation, contraceptive (unproven), cystitis, diabetes treatment, digestion (stimulates), dyspepsia, eczema, fevers, flus, gastritis, glandular system, gum ailments, Heartbeat (slow), influenza, insect repellent, internal bleeding, liver (stimulates and regulates), lungs (hemorrhage), measles, menses (suppressed), menorrhagia, Menstruation (regulates, relieves pain), Nipples (soreness), nosebleeds, piles (bleeding), smallpox, stomach sickness, toothache, thrombosis, ulcers, urinary antiseptic, Uterus (tighten and contract), varicose veins, vision. 
The salicylic acid derivatives are a component of aspirin, which may account for its use in treating fevers and reducing pain. Yarrow tea is also said to be able to clear up a cold within 24 hours.
Yarrow is considered an especially useful companion plant, not only repelling some bad insects while attracting good, predatory ones, but also improving soil quality. It attracts predatory wasps, which drink the nectar and then use insect pests as food for their larvae. Similarly, it attracts ladybugs and hoverflies. Its leaves are thought to be good fertilizer, and a beneficial additive for compost.
It is also considered directly beneficial to other plants, improving the health of sick plants when grown near them.
Hemlock Woolly Adelgid ("Adelges tsugae") or HWA is a destructive pest that poses a major threat to eastern and Carolina hemlock trees throughout their range. Accidentally introduced from Asia in the 1920s, HWA feeds on hemlock and has now been established in 11 eastern states from North Carolina to Massachusetts, causing widespread mortality of hemlock trees. HWA has been found 20 miles from Vermont, 5 miles from New Hampshire, and 25 miles from Maine. 
The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is an introduced aphid-like insect that feeds on the phloem sap of tender hemlock shoots. 
In the northern portion of hemlocks' range, mortality typically occurs within 4 to 10 years following infestation.
Hemlock is a vital component of the New England forest system, and is the third most prevalent tree in Vermont. Hemlock provides protection from erosion along stream banks, food for deer and wildlife, and shelter for deer in the winter. Major changes in ecosystem structure and function, including hydrologic processes, is expected with the loss of hemlock.
Unlike the Balsam Woolly Adelgid that only attacks mature balsam fir, HWA infests all age classes of hemlock. In addition, where hemlock occurs in pure stands in northern regions, the most commonly observed tree species to succeed hemlock is black (sweet) birch.
Few options are available for control of this pest. The use of pesticides is limited because in forested lands, hemlocks often grow along streams, swamps, or lakes and the threat of aquatic pollution is great. In urban communities the general public does not favor the use of these materials. Alternative management options are needed and the potential use of entomopathogenic fungi is a viable tool for consideration. 
Steps that have been taken to eradicate this pest:
Agrimony ("Agrimonia") is a genus of 12-15 species of perennial plants in the family Rosaceae, native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with one species also in Africa.
The species grow to between 0.5–2 m tall, with pinnate leaves, and yellow flowers borne on a single (usually unbranched) spike. The bur-like seeds are very sticky, persisting through the winter.
Historically, the plants were thought to have medicinal value.
In wicca (witchcraft) it is used to help create a deep, undisturbed sleep by slipping dried leaves inside the sleeper's pillow.
Agrimonia was first described in writing by the Greeks who used it to treat conjunctivitus, other eye ailments, wounds (especially on the battle field), and liver ailments. Agrimonia is Latin, a variant of argemonia, and comes from the Greek word agermone which translates to, "speck in the eye." Eupatoria, as in agrimonia eupatoria, is derived from the name of King Mithridates IV Eupator (132 BC-63BC), ruler of Pontus in northern Turkey. He is well known in history for his knowledge of plant lore as well as the Mithridates Wars which he lead against the Romans. Agrimonia has been used since ancient times in Egypt to treat the digestive system and in Eastern Asia it is still used to treat heavy bleeding, coughs and flu.
The Anglo Saxons knew agrimonia as "garclive," and used it for wounds, warts, snake bites and, as did the Romans, eye ailments and liver disease. English poet Michael Drayton (1563–1631) declared agrimony to be an, "all heal" herb. In France and later throughout Europe it was an active ingredient in arquebusade water, which was used to treat wounds inflicted by an arquebus, a small gun operated by a matchlock mechanism dating to the 15th century.
Recent studies published by The U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) and other scientific institutions suggest that chemicals in the plant may stimulate Cytokines which are proteins that stimulate the immune system.
Very low maintenance, transplants easily.
By division or seed.
Control may be needed if growing where pets play, as the seeds of some species are very difficult to remove from fur and clothing.
The Turnip Moth ("Agrotis segetum") is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is a common European species, but is also present in other parts of the world as a root-feeding pest of both vegetable and cereal crops. The insect is not believed to be present in the United States, where the government has been making efforts to prevent its introduction on imported food crops.
This is a very variable species with the forewings ranging from pale buff through to almost black. The paler forms have three dark-bordered stigmata on each forewing. The main distinguishing feature from other "Agrotis" species is the very pale hindwings, pure white in the males, pearly grey in the females. The wingspan is 32–42 mm. The grey larva, sometimes tinged with purple, feeds on the roots and lower stems of a huge range of plants (see list below).
Two broods are produced each year, with the adults flying in May and June and again in August and September (in Britain). The species flies at night and is attracted to light and nectar-rich flowers. The species overwinters as a caterpillar.
Ailanthus altissima (Tree of Heaven or Ailanthus) is a member of the quassia family, ../Simaroubaceae/, native to northeast and central China, and Taiwan, but now presently an invasive weed throughout much of the world. It is a deciduous tree which grows rapidly and can reach up to 25 m tall, rarely 35 m, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter, rarely 1.5 m diameter. The common name is a direct translation of the Indonesian name "ailanto" for a closely related species in the same genus. Other common names include china sumac, copal tree, stinktree and ghetto palm.
The tree is occasionally planted in heavily polluted areas as it is tolerant of both particulate and chemical pollutants, as well as saline soils. Outside those areas, it should never be planted due to its invasive nature.
The bark of the tree is smooth and light grey, while the stems are reddish or chestnut. Its large, compound leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, and can be 30–60 cm long (occasionally up to 1 m long on vigorous young sprouts) and contain 11-33 leaflets, occasionally up to 41 leaflets. Each leaflet has one to three teeth on each side, close to the base. This helps distinguish it from sumacs ("Rhus" spp.).
The flowers are small, yellow-green to reddish, produced in late spring to mid summer in panicles up to 30 cm long. It is dioecious, with trees being either all male or all female. The seed is 5 mm diameter, encapsulated in a samara 4 cm long and 1 cm broad; the samara is twisted, making it spin as it falls, assisting wind dispersal. Female trees can produce more than 300,000 seeds in a year. All parts of the tree produce an unpleasant odour, suggestive of rancid cashews, with male flowers having the strongest smell.
In overall appearance, it is somewhat similar to some species of sumac; Staghorn Sumac "../Rhus typhina/" can be distinguished by sumac's red and slightly hairy stems, as well as leaves that are serrated, instead of having the base teeth of "A. altissima". Smooth Sumac "../Rhus glabra/", also lacks the base teeth of "A. altissima". Ailanthus also grows much taller than all sumac species. Seedlings of the Black walnut ("../Juglans nigra/") can also sometimes be mistaken for this plant, but their trunks are more slender as a sapling.
Ailanthus is an opportunistic species, thriving in full sun and in disturbed areas. It does, however, exhibit some shade tolerance. It spreads aggressively both by seeds and vegetatively, through root sprouts. It can resprout rapidly after being cut. Ailanthus is among the most tolerant of all tree species to pollution, including sulfur dioxide, and high soil acidity such as that from acid mine drainage (as low as pH 4.1). It has been noted as drought-tolerant, storing water in its root system. It is frequently found along highways and railroad tracks, in abandoned lots in cities, on abandoned mining sites, and in other areas where few trees can survive. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present.
Ailanthus produces allelopathic chemicals, which inhibit the growth of other plants. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure; populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. A few plants are resistant to these chemicals and form associations with Ailanthus in areas where it is dominant, such as along highways.
People have suggested many factors to Ailanthus' success at naturalising, including the absence of insects eating the plant, lack of exposure of native plants to the Ailanthus' allelopathy, and the widespread human disturbances which favour the tree. Regional variation has begun to show throughout its range, with trees in the colder northern regions producing heavier seeds than those in warmer regions.
Tree of Heaven is a popular ornamental tree in China, valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions, and its uses in Chinese traditional medicine. The bark is used to treat dysentery and other bowel ailments. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy. The leaves are also used to feed silkworms of the moth "Samia cynthia", which produces silk that is stronger and cheaper than mulberry silk, although with inferior gloss and texture. There are also records of the wood from this tree being used in China. Under the synonymous name ""A. glandulosa"", an extract of the bark is sometimes touted as an herbal homeopathic remedy for various ailments. However, taken in large doses, the bark extract is highly toxic.
It was first introduced to Europe (France and England) by a French Jesuit priest returning from Nanking in 1751. It was brought to the United States by William Hamilton, a gardener in Philadelphia in 1784 and soon became a favoured ornamental tree in parks and gardens. By 1840, it was available in many nurseries and was planted as an ornamental. The tree arrived in the Western U.S. with the Chinese immigrants who worked the gold mines in California. To this day many abandoned mines have large colonies of it.
In the landscape these trees can cause problems because of their aggressive nature and weak branching habits. As a rule, they should not be planted outside of their native range, and female trees should be killed or kept cut to the ground to prevent further seed production. Male trees can be grown as a fast-replenishing postwood crop or hedge by coppicing at the ground every few years.
Tree-of-heaven has become a problematic invasive species in many areas with warm temperate climates, especially in North America, due to its aggressive spread, vigorous growth and allelopathic chemicals. It often grows directly up against a building or structure, where the roots can damage sewers and housing foundations. The trees grow rapidly and produce many offspring in their root vicinity. They also shed many small branches at regular intervals. It is an agricultural pest as well. These undesirable qualities often lead land and business owners to eradicate the plant.
Many different methods of control have been attempted and the best involve prevention as well as eradication. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological, or chemical. A combination of these can be most effective, though they must be compatible. Physical methods are desirable due to their high selectivity, but are very labour intensive and thus more expensive. Hand-pulling is a highly effective way to remove young seedlings before the development of a tap root, but thereafter it is ineffective. Cutting and hand digging are options for larger trees, but the former will produce stump sprout which will need to be controlled later and the latter is very time consuming and is only practical for small infestations. Girdling, the removal of the cambial tissue with a hand axe or machete, is effective for very large trees, though re-sprouting often occurs. Thermal control, i.e. controlled burning, is also effective at removing the visible portion of trees, but sprouts will occur shortly after. These methods can be counter-productive if not performed regularly. On their own they are most effective in places with small infestations or in areas with fairly strong shade or competition. The root systems will eventually become exhausted and die if mechanical or thermal control is done thoroughly and consistently, though this may take several years.
Managerial control is not effective with controlling ailanthus as native trees cannot compete easily with the tree and it is unpalatable to animals that could potentially graze on it. Biological control, the use of insects or diseases, is also not in use for ailanthus eradication. Chemical control, however, is quite successful, especially when combined with mechanical methods. Foliar herbicide sprays are very effective when plants are in full leaf, but are difficult to use when desirable plants are in the vicinity. Also very large trees will be out of reach. Herbicides for this use include the non-selective glyphosate, though care must be taken as it is mildly toxic to animals and especially to aquatic life. Its trade names include "Accord" and "Roundup", though the latter contains other harmful surfactants which may be more toxic than the herbicide itself. Triclopyr is another option and is selective for woody plants, making it a better choice for sensitive areas. It is also non-toxic to fish, though it can be toxic to waterfowl. It is sold under brand names such as "Garlon". Foliar applications of glyphosate have been shown to be slightly more effective than triclopyr. Dicamba, imazapyr and metsulfuron methyl are also effective, but have not been tested extensively with ailanthus.
Other chemical methods for controlling ailanthus include a basal bark application of oil-soluble triclopyr in late winter or early spring. This method requires no cutting, but is only effective on trees with a diameter of 15 cm (6 inches) or less. For larger trees, an effective method is to cut off strips of bark at the trunk during the summer and spray a 100% concentration of triclopyr, only about 1 or 2 ml per cut, within a few minutes. The tree should not be cut all the way around in a ring, but rather only a ring with 3 to 6 cm (1 to 2 inch) pieces of living bark in between each cut. Cutting a full ring will kill the upper part of the tree and cause root suckers to sprout. Lastly, trees can be cut down and the stump treated with any of the above herbicides, though they must be applied immediately after cutting. This is most effective during the growing season.
Ajuga reptans (Blue bugle, Bugleherb, Bugleweed, Carpetweed, Common bugle, Carpenter's Herb) is a herbaceous flowering plant native to Europe. This plant is often used as medicinal and ornamental plant. Bugle is also known as "carpenter's herb" due to its supposed ability to stem bleeding.
The bugle has dark green leaves with purple highlights. It is a spreading ground cover that grows in a dense mat. The leaves grow 2-3 inches high but in the spring it sends up 4-6 inch tall flower stalks densely covered with numerous purple or blue flowers.
Alchemilla mollis, Lady's Mantle, is an herbaceous perennial plant native to Southern Europe, but grown throughout the world as an ornamental garden plant. The plant is primarily grown as a ground cover, and is especially valued for the leaves in wet weather, as the water beads up and sparkles on the leaves.
The leaves are palmately veined, with a scalloped and serrated margin. The flowers are held in dense clusters above the foliage and are greenish yellow.
Rich, well-drained soils in ful sun to very light shade.
Some cultivars have been selected.
The plant has been used for centuries as a herbal remedy. Since it contains tannin, Lady's Mantle has properties of an astringent. It is also used by some as a gynecological treatment to suppress menstruation and reduce vagina irritation. No scientific studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of Alchemilla mollis as an herbal treatment.
Prune off browned foliage in early spring. Deadhead to prevent seeding and encourage rebloom.

Garlic mustard or Hedge garlic ("Alliaria petiolata") is a flowering plant in the Mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is native to Europe, western and central Asia, and northwestern Africa, from Morocco, Iberia and the British Isles, north to northern Scandinavia, and east to northern India and western China (Xinjiang). It often occurs along the margins of hedgerows, giving rise to the old British folk name of "Jack-by-the-hedge". The genus name "Alliaria", "resembling "Allium"", refers to the garlic-like odour of the crushed foliage.
It is a herbaceous biennial plant (sometimes an annual plant) growing to 30–100 cm (rarely to 130 cm) tall. The leaves are stalked, triangular to heart-shaped, 10–15 cm long (of which about half being the petiole) and 2–6 cm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. In biennial specimens, first-year plants appear as a rosette of green leaves close to the ground; these rosettes remain green through the winter and develop into mature flowering plants the following spring. Others flower and complete their life-cycle in their first year. The flowers are produced in spring and summer in buttonlike clusters, each flower small, white, with four petals 4–8 mm long and 2–3 mm broad, in the shape of a cross. The fruit is an erect, slender, four-sided pod 2–7 cm long, called a silique, green maturing pale grey-brown, containing two rows of small shiny black seeds which are released when the pod splits open. 
A single plant can produce hundreds of seeds, which scatter as much as several metres from the parent plant. Depending upon conditions, garlic mustard flowers either self-fertilise or are cross-pollinated by a variety of insects. Self-fertilised seed is genetically identical to the parent plant, enhancing its ability to colonise an area. Although water may transport the seeds, they do not float well and are not carried far by wind. Long distance dispersal is most likely aided by human activities and wildlife.
In Europe as many as 69 species of insects and 7 species of fungi utilise Garlic Mustard as a food plant, including the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as the Garden carpet moth.
Garlic mustard was introduced in North America as a culinary herb in the 1860s and is considered an invasive species there. The insects and fungi that feed on it in natural conditions are not present in North America, increasing its seed productivity and allowing it to out-compete native plants there. In addition, a study published in 2006 concluded that Garlic Mustard harms mycorrhizal fungi that some North American plants, including native forest trees, require for proper growth. Additionally, because White-tailed Deer rarely eat Garlic Mustard, large deer populations may help to expand it by removing competing native plants and exposing the soil and seedbed through trampling. A complication in the eradication of Garlic Mustard is the long time span in which seeds may remain viable in the ground for. Seeds have been observed to germinate up to 11 years after being planted in the ground.
The leaves, flowers and fruit are edible as food for humans, and are best when young. They have a mild flavour of both garlic and mustard, and are used in salads.
In the rosette stage it can be easily confused with "../Brunnera macrophylla/" or sometimes "../Glechome hederacea/" or "../Asarum canadensis/".
Allium vineale (Crow Garlic) is a perennial bulb in the genus "../Allium/", native to Europe, north Africa and western Asia, but present elsewhere as an invasive weed of gardens, woodlands, and lawns.
All parts of the plant have a strong garlic odor. The underground bulb is 1–2 cm diameter, with a fibrous outer layer. The main stem grows to 30–120 cm tall, bearing 2-4 leaves and an apical inflorescence 2–5 cm diameter comprising a number of small bulbils and none to a few flowers, subtended by a basal bract. The leaves are slender, hollow. and tubular, 15–60 cm long and 2–4 mm thick, waxy textured, with a groove along the side of the leaf facing the stem. The flowers are 2–5 mm long, with six petals varying in colour from pink to red or greenish-white. It flowers in the summer, June to August in northern Europe. Plants with no flowers, only bulbils, are sometimes distinguished as the variety "Allium vineale" var. "compactum", but this character is probably not taxonomically significant.
It is a weed in grain fields, as grain products may become tainted with a garlic odor or flavour in the presence of aerial bulblets at the time of harvest. Wild garlics is resistant to herbicides due to the structure of its leaves, being vertical, smooth and waxy. Herbicides do not cling well to it and are therefore not as effective.
The species is introduced in Australia and North America, where it has become an invasive species.
Crow Garlic can be used as a substitute for garlic. It imparts a garlic-like flavour and odor on dairy and beef products when grazed by livestock.
Garden pests often feed on plants other than just those being intentionally grown in gardens. Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for plant pests, so in order to control a serious infestation, it may be important to also either control the pests on the weed plants or simply remove the weed population.
Ambrosia is a genus of flowering plants from the sunflower family (Asteraceae), commonly referred to as Ragweeds. The name of this genus is derived from the Greek word for "food of the gods".
These are annuals, perennials and shrubs and subshrubs with erect, hispid stems growing in large clumps to a height of 75 – 90 cm. The stems are basally branched. They form a slender taproot or a creeping rhizome.
The foliage is grayish to silvery green with bipinnatifid, deeply lobed leaves with winged petioles. But in the case of "Ambrosia coronopifolia", the leaves are simple. The leaf arrangement is opposite at the base, but becomes alternate higher on the stem.
Ambrosia is a monoecious plant, i.e. it produces separate male and female flower heads on the same plant. The numerous tiny male, yellowish-green disc flower are about 3 mm in diameter. They grow in a terminal spike, subtended by joined bracts. The female, whitish-green flowers are 1-flowered and are inconspicuously situated below the male ones, in the leaf axils. The pappus is lacking.
After wind pollination, the female flowers develops into a prickly, ovoid burr with 9-18 straight spines. It contains one arrowhead-shaped seed, brown when mature, and smaller than a wheat grain. This burr gets dispersed by clinging to the fur or feathers of animals passing by. The seeds are an important winter food for many bird species.
Ragweed occurs in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and South America. They prefer dry, sunny grassy plains; sandy soils; and to grow along river banks, along roadsides, disturbed soils, vacant lots and ruderal sites. Ragweed was far less common in the Eastern United States before dense European settlement/agriculture in the late 1700s.
There are 41 species worldwide. They are very ordinary in appearance. Despite being all around, they are easily overlooked. Virtually no animal browses them. Many are adapted to the arid climates of the desert. Burrobush ("Ambrosia dumosa") is one of the most arid-adapted perennials in North America. About 10 species occur in the Sonoran Desert.
Each plant is reputed to be able to produce about a billion grains of pollen over a season, and the plant is anemophilous (wind-pollinated). It is highly allergenic, as the greatest pollen allergen of all pollens, and the prime cause of hayfever. The plant blooms in the northern hemisphere from about mid August until cooler weather arrives. It usually produces pollen more copiously in wet seasons. Two species, "Ambrosia artemisiifolia" and "A. psilostachya" are considered among the most noxious to those prone to hay fever.
Total eradication of ragweed is considered impossible, owing to the plant's frugality and tremendous seed-producing capability. As of 2005, there is no known safe biological remedy (e.g. beetle or worm) to be used against ragweed in the open. Mechanical and chemical methods are available and can be used to control its spread, although there is evidence that these are actually no more effective than leaving the weed alone, in the long run .
The act of manually uprooting ragweeds, sometimes shown in the media for public awareness and propaganda purposes, is best avoided. It is ineffective, and skin contact may cause the onset of full-blown hayfever symptoms in persons with latent ragweed hyper-sensitivity.
Although the scythe and its motorized descendants have a reduced efficiency against ragweed, they remain indispensable tools, especially in populated areas and near delicate plantation, where herbicide use must be limited. Fighting ragweed with the scythe is a continuous process, because it is difficult to cut the plant right at the soil level, and the plant will regrow in two weeks (and often branch into three or four full-sized stems) if more than half an inch of the plant remains above the ground. Areas where ragweed has been reaped should be mowed down every three weeks to prevent regrowth.
It is considered important to control the spread of ragweed in large abandoned or uncultivated areas. Ragweed pollen can remain airborne for days and travel great distances, affecting people hundreds of miles away. One efficient method for large-scale ragweed extermination is chemical spraying. Because ragweed only reacts to some of the more aggressive herbicides, it is highly recommended to consult professionals when deciding on dosage and methodology, especially near urban areas. Some proven effective active ingredients include those that are gliphosat-based (Roundup, Gliphogan, Glialka), sulphosat-based (Medallon) and gluphosinat-ammonia based (Finale14SL). In badly infested areas usually 2 to 6.5 liters of herbicides are dispersed per hectare (equal to app. 0.2 to 0.7 US gallons per acre).
One especially effective method of controlling ragweed; cutting it, then burning it once the stalks have dried (standing, live ragweed won't burn) has become less popular because the smoke produced is seen as unacceptable pollution, as with the decline in leaf-burning and trash burning. But this method has the added benefit of killing off the stems so the plant does not grow back, which (as noted above) is otherwise almost inevitable.

w:list of Lepidoptera which feed on ragweeds.
Common Ragweed ("Ambrosia artemisiifolia") is the most widespread of this genus in North America. It attains a height of about a meter. Great Ragweed, Giant Ragweed or Horseweed, ("Ambrosia trifida"), may grow to four meters (13 feet) or more.
Ragweed is a plant of concern in the global warming issue, because tests have shown that higher levels of carbon dioxide will greatly increase pollen production. On dry windy days, the pollen will travel many kilometers. When the humidity rises above 70%, the pollen tends to clump and is not so likely to become airborne.
Goldenrod is frequently blamed for hayfever, but simply happens to have a showy flower that blooms about the same time. Goldenrod is innocent, as it is entomophilous, i.e. insect pollinated. Its pollen is heavy and sticky, and cannot become airborne.
Some high mountain and desert areas of North America used to be refuges for severe hay fever sufferers, who would go to such areas for relief during the pollen season, but increased human activity such as building and other disturbances of the soil, irrigation, and gardening, have encouraged ragweed to spread to these areas as well. Today, no area in the United States is ragweed pollen free, and moving can only offer a degree of relief. The ragweed was accidentally imported to Europe during World War I, it had adapted to the different environment successfully and has greatly spread since the 1950s. Hungary is currently the most heavily affected country in Europe (and possibly the entire world), especially since the early 1990s, when abandonment of communist-style collective agriculture left vast fields uncultivated, which were promptly invaded by ragweed.
Anecdotal claims are made of honey giving some relief for ragweed pollen allergies, which is noteworthy because honeybees very rarely visit ragweed flowers, and even then only for pollen. However, during ragweed pollen shed, the pollen dusts every surface, and honeybees, being electrostatically charged, will accumulate some ragweed pollen. The pollen is frequently identified as a component of raw honey.
The major allergen protein has been identified as Amb a 1, a 38 kDa nonglycosylated protein.
Amelanchier, also known as shadbush, serviceberry, sarvisberry, juneberry, saskatoon, shadblow, shadwood, sugarplum, wild-plum, and mespilus,is a genus of about 20 species of small deciduous trees and large shrubs in the family Rosaceae.
The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, growing primarily in early successional habitats. It is most diverse taxomically in North America, especially in the northern United States and southern Canada, and is native to every state of the United States except Hawaii. Two species also occur in Asia, and one in Europe. These plants are valued horticulturally, and their fruits are important to wildlife. The systematics (taxonomy) of shadbushes has long perplexed botanists, horticulturalists, and others, as suggested by the range in number of species recognized in the genus from 6 to 33 in two recent publications. A major source of complexity comes from the occurrence of apomixis (asexual seed production), polyploidy, and hybridization. 
The origin of the generic name "Amelanchier" is probably derived from the Provençal name of the European "../Amelanchier ovalis/". The name serviceberry comes from the similarity of the fruit to the related European "../Sorbus/". A widespread folk etymology states that the plant's flowering time signaled to early American pioneers that the ground had thawed enough in spring for the burial of the winter's dead. Juneberry refers to the fruits of certain species becoming ripe in June. The name Saskatoon originated from a Cree Native American noun "misâskwatômina" ("misāskwatōmina", "misaaskwatoomina") for "Amelanchier alnifolia". The city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan is named after this plant.
"Amelanchier" species grow to 0.2–20 m tall, arborecent or suckering and forming loose colonies or dense clumps to single-stemmed. The bark is gray or less often brown, smooth or fissuring in older trees. The leaves are deciduous, cauline, alternate, simple, lanceolate to elliptic to orbiculate, 0.5–10 x 0.5–5.5 cm, thin to coriaceous, with surfaces abaxially glabrous or densely tomentose at flowering, abaxially glabrous or more or less hairy at maturity. The inflorescences are terminal, with 1–20 flowers, erect or drooping, either in clusters of one to four flowers, or in racemes with 4–20 flowers. The flowers have five white (rarely somewhat pink, yellow, or streaked with red), linear to orbiculate petals, 2.6–25 mm long, occasionally andropetalous (bearing apical microsporangia adaxially; only known in this genus in A. nantucketensis). The flowers appear in early spring, "when the shad run" according to tradition (leading to names such as "shadbush"). The fruit is a berry-like pome, red to purple to nearly black at maturity, 5–15 mm diameter, insipid to delectably sweet, maturing in summer.
For North American species, the taxonomy follows the forthcoming "Flora of North America"; for Asian species the "Flora of China"; and for European species the "Flora Europaea".
Several natural hybrids also exist. A taxon commonly cited as "../Amelanchier lamarckii/" F.G.Schroed. is very widely cultivated and naturalized in Europe, where it was introduced in the 17th century; it is known to be of North American origin, probably from eastern Canada. It is not currently known to occur in the wild, and is probably of hybrid origin between "A. laevis" and either "A. arborea" or "A. canadensis"; it is apomictic and breeds true from seed.
The fruit of several species are excellent to eat raw, tasting like a slightly nutty blueberry, though their popularity with birds makes harvesting difficult. Fruit is harvested locally for pies and jams. The saskatoon berry is harvested commercially. The Native American food pemmican was flavored by shadbush fruits in combination with fat and dried meats, and the stems were made into arrow shafts.
Several species are very popular ornamental shrubs, grown for their flowers, bark, and fall color. Most need similar conditions to grow well, requiring good drainage, air circulation (to discourage leaf diseases), watering during drought and acceptable soil. One exception is "A. bartramiana" which, among other places in the wild, has been found growing in swamps and bogs. Note that species names are often used interchangeably in the nursery trade. Many A. arborea plants that are offered for sale are actually hybrids, or entirely different species.
The wood is brown, hard, close-grained, and heavy. The heartwood is reddish-brown, and the sapwood is lighter in color. It can be used for tool handles and fishing rods.
Propagation is by seed, divisions and grafting. Serviceberries graft so readily that grafts with other genera, such as "../Crataegus/" and "../Sorbus/", are often successful.
"Amelanchier" are preferred browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of Lepidoptera such as w:Brimstone Moth, w:Brown-tail, w:Grey Dagger, w:Mottled Umber, w:Rough Prominent, The Satellite, w:Winter Moth, "w:Limenitis arthemis" and other herbivorous insects also have a taste for serviceberry. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and "../Gymnosporangium/" ../rust/. In years when late flowers overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial ../fireblight/. 
An Introduction to Soils
Horticulture is meant to eventually become an exhaustive technical manual for professionals in the horticulture trade, as well as a guidebook for gardeners of every level of expertise. The scope of the book includes garden techniques, materials, soils, plants, weeds, diseases, pests, hotricultural chemicals, and beneficial insects.
Because of this large scope, this "Wikimanual" is not intended to be printed out as "one big book", since this would (after a few years of development) be far too thick a book to fit on any real-world bookshelf. Rather, it is meant to be printed out module-by-module, to cover topic areas for classrooms, or as "custom garden guides" for individual gardeners (only including those pages that pertain to a specific garden).
Because of the free licensing on Wikibooks, this means that any instructor can create textbooks for a specific class they are teaching, without any need to seek permissions or pay licensing fees. So, for example, an instructor could assemble a book for a two semester course on herbaceous ornamental plants that is specific to the lesson plan, and includes exhaustive discussion of how to grow and maintain any particular plant, from siting and fertilization to pest and disease control to commercial propagation methods.
Instructors can also use Wikibooks as a venue for class assignments: the edits of each student can be seen on their account logs, and they can of course be assigned particular tasks, such as writing entries for a set of plants, insects, diseases, and so on.
For amateur gardeners, this "Wikimanual" is a place for both learning and sharing "tips and tricks" they have learned from others or invented themselves. "Expert amateurs" often wish that "landscapers" knew how to do things better, and this "Wikimanual" is an excellent way to share (in fact, the free license allows anyone to print out copies and distribute them, and even tuck them under windshield wipers).
There are many ways in which to contribute, from indexing to copyediting to maintenance to creating new content. For cleanup and maintenance, a few templates and categories exist for this, such as (for cleaning up transwikis that haven't yet been completely modified to fit the "Wikimanual's" Manual of Style).
Images are also needed for many pages, particularly those pages that describe a process such as ../Division/, ../Pruning/, and other garden techniques. These should be uploaded to rather than to Wikibooks, because in the future much of this book might be translated into other languages.
There are also many stubs that need to be further developed.
Many pages are orphaned and need to be linked to from the table of contents or a listing linked to from the table of contents. See all the pages of the book in :.
New content is of course the most important need, since while there are already hundreds of "chapters", there are thousands of plants, pests, diseases, techniques, and so on. In general, the best way to start new chapters is by transwikiing content from Wikipedia using the , which copies all revisions and thus honors our copyrights. Only administrators can use the Import tool. To request an import from administrators, list the Wikipedia article name at .

Aphids, also known as greenfly, blackfly or plant lice, are minute plant-feeding insects in the superfamily Aphidoidea in the homopterous division of the order Hemiptera. Recent classification within the Hemiptera has changed the old term 'Homoptera' to two suborders: Sternorryncha (aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids...) and Auchenorryncha (cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers...) with the suborder: Heteroptera containing a large group of insects known as the 'true-bugs'; gnat bugs, pond skaters, shore bugs, toad bugs, water boatmen, backswimmers, etc.
About 4,000 species of aphids are known, classified in 10 families; of these, around 250 species are serious pests for agriculture and forestry as well as an annoyance for gardeners. They vary in size from 1–10 mm long.
The most typical organ of aphids is their piercing-sucking mouthparts called stylets. They have soft bodies, long, thin legs, two-jointed, two-clawed tarsi, and usually a pair of abdominal tubes through which a waxy secretion is exuded. These tubes were formerly supposed to secrete the sweet substance known as "honeydew" so much sought after by ants; but this is now known to come from the alimentary canal. Both winged and wingless forms of both sexes occur; the wings when present are two pairs, lacy, transparent and only have one prominent longitudinal vein. Aphids also have a proboscis originating between and behind the forelegs. Aphids' antennae are composed of two thick basal segments and a flagellum with as many as four segments. The last of these four segments is divided into a proximal part and a thinner distal part (called "process terminalis").
Aphids have two compound eyes and two ocular tubercles made up of three lenses, each of which is located behind and above the compound eyes. They have two tarsal segments. The fifth abdominal segment bears a pair of tubes on the dorsal surface named siphunculi (cornicles), which are upright and point backward. A cauda is usually present below and between them on the last abdominal segment.
Aphids are distributed world-wide, but they are most common in temperate zones. It is possible for aphids to migrate great distances (mainly through passive dispersal riding on winds) depending on the weather patterns; for example, the lettuce aphid spreading from New Zealand to Tasmania. They have also been spread by human transportation of infested plant materials.
Many, but far from all, aphids are monophagous (i.e. feeding only on 1 species of plant). Others, like "../Myzus persicae/" feed on hundreds of plant species across many families.
Similarly to related families, aphids passively feed on sap of phloem vessels in plants. This sap being kept under high pressure, once a phloem vessel is punctured, it is forced into the food canal. Aphids actively 'drink' (suck) from xylem vessels when thirsty. As they feed, aphids often transmit plant viruses to their food plants. These viruses can sometimes kill the plants.
Some species of ants "farm" aphids, protecting them on the plant they eat, and eating the honeydew that the aphids secrete; this is a mutualistic relationship. Aphid honeydew is rich in carbohydrates (like melezitose), of which the aphids ingest an excess, being phloem-feeders. Many aphids are host to endosymbiont bacteria, "Buchnera", which live in specialized cells called Bacteriocytes inside the aphid. These bacteria synthesizes some essential amino acids that are absent in the phloem that the aphids eat.
Apart from their importance from the economic standpoint, aphids are chiefly remarkable for the phenomena connected with the propagation of the species. For part or all of their life, most aphids are often found to be parthenogenetic. Aphids have been known to have what is called telescoping generations. With telescoping generations the female aphid will have a daughter within her who is already parthenogenetically producing its own daughter at the same time. This leads to the bizarre situation where the diet of a female aphid can have inter-generational effects on the body size and birth rate of aphids. In other words, what the aphid eats can directly change the size and fertility of the aphid's daughters and grand-daughters (Nevo and Coll 2001, Jahn et al. 2005).
At different times of the year, they can be viviparous or oviparous. During spring and summer, aphids are often parthenogenetic and viviparous and then give birth sexually during autumn. Therefore aphids are said to undergo cyclical parthenogenesis or to have a holocyclical life circle.
Male and female aphids mate in autumn. Sexual females, but also asexual ones, have two sex chromosomes while sexual males only have one.
The following brief summary of what takes place in the plant-louse of the rose ("Aphis rosae"), may be regarded as typical of the family, though exceptions occur in other species: Eggs produced in the autumn by fertilized females remain on the plant through the winter and hatching in the spring give rise to female individuals which may be winged or wingless. From these, females are born parthenogenetically: that is to say, without the intervention of males, and by a process that has been compared to internal budding, large numbers of young resembling their parents in every respect except size are produced, which themselves reproduce their kind in the same way. This process continues throughout the summer, generation after generation being produced until the number of descendants from a single individual of the spring-hatched brood may amount to many thousands. In the autumn winged males appear; union between the sexes takes place and the females lay the fertilized eggs which are destined to carry the species through the cold months of winter. If, however, the food-plant is grown in a glasshouse or greenhouse where protection against cold is afforded, the aphids may go on reproducing agamogenetically (asexually) without cessation for many years. 
Likewise, in warm and tropical areas or during the growing season, aphids reproduce asexually without interruption. Since the young can become adults and reproduce within a few days, this process leads to the build-up of very large populations responsible for severe damage to crops and important economic losses; such populations often require pest control.
Not the least interesting features connected with this strange life-history are the facts that the young may be born by the oviparous or viviparous methods and either gamogenetically or agamogenetically, and may develop into winged forms or remain wingless, and that the males only appear in any number at the close of the season. Although the factors which determine these phenomena are not clearly understood, it is believed that the appearance of the males is connected with the increasing cold of autumn and the growing scarcity of food, and that the birth of winged females is similarly associated with decrease in the quantity or vitiation of the quality of the nourishment imbibed. Sometimes the winged females migrate from the plant they were born on to start fresh colonies on others often of quite a different kind (host plant alternancy). Thus the apple aphid ("Aphis Mali") after producing many generations of apterous females on its typical food-plant gives rise to winged forms which fly away and settle upon grass or corn-stalks.
Another widespread aphid in the Phylloxeridae family is "Daktulosphairia vitifoliae" (still frequently called by its former name "Phylloxera vitifoliae"), the famous Phylloxera which causes enormous loss by attacking the leaves and roots of grape vines. Its life-history is similar to that of "Aphis rosae" described above. In the autumn a single fertile egg is laid by apterous females in a crevice of the bark of the vine where it is protected during the winter. From this egg in the spring emerges an apterous female who makes a gall in the new leaf and lays therein a large number of eggs. Some of the apterous young that are hatched from these form fresh galls and continue to multiply in the leaves, others descend to the root of the plant, becoming what are known as root-forms. These, like the parent form of spring, reproduce parthenogenetically, giving rise to generation after generation of egg-laying individuals. In the course of the summer, from some of these eggs are hatched females which acquire wings and lay eggs from which wingless males and females are born. From the union of the sexes comes the fertile egg from which the parent form of spring is hatched.
Some species of cabbage aphids (like "Brevicoryne brassicae") reproduce rapidly during the summer. They are all females, and can produce up to 41 generations of offspring. If no aphids had died during the summer, there would be more than one and a half billion billion billion aphids (1.5 x 10) by the end of the season.
There are 10 families:
A wide range of plants are affected by aphids. Many aphids feed specificallly on a small group of plants, but others are generalists.
The Bean Aphid is most notable as an agricultural pest of beans, but also feeds on a wide variety of garden plants, both woody and herbaceous.
Dark-colored aphids.Black or dark green in colour. Legs and antannae are yellow in colour. Bulbous abdomen and conicles on the abdomen.
Leaf-curling, sooty mold.
Aphis gossypii is a major pest of cotton and other crops, and a common pest of gardens.
Host plants include those of the following genera (as well as many others):
Artemisia vulgaris (Mugwort) is a species in the family ../Asteraceae/. It is one of several species in the genus "Artemisia/" known as mugwort, and is also occasionally known as Felon Herb, St. John's Plant, Chrysanthemum Weed, and Wild Wormwood. It is native to temperate Europe, Asia and northern Africa, but is also present in North America as an invasive weed. It is a very common plant on nitrogenous soils such as waste places and roadsides.
It is a tall herbaceous perennial plant growing 1–2 m (rarely 2.5 m) tall, with a woody root. The leaves are 5–20 cm long, dark green, pinnate, with dense white tomentose hairs on the underside. The erect stem often has a red-purplish tinge.
The rather small flowers (5 mm long) are radially symmetrical with many yellow or dark red petals. The narrow and numerous capitula (flower heads) spread out in racemose panicles. It flowers from July to September.
"A. vulgaris" is often confused with the Chinese mugwort ("A. verlotiorum"), which is very common too. The latter has oblonge reddish to brown capitula, its stems are green and the leaves broader, lighter coloured and more dense on the stem. The plant's scent is both stronger and more pleasant than that of the common mugwort. It flowers very late in the summer, but reproduces mainly by stolons, thus forming thick groups. The two species share the same habitats.
Mugwort is also sometimes confused with the ragweeds. In the garden, the foliage can look similar to that of hardy mums (Dendranthema spp.), but can be distinguished easily by the light-colored undersides of the leaves, as opposed to the green undersides of chrysanthemum leaves.
Mugwort has both culinary and herbal uses. See the wikipedia article on Artemisia vulgaris for details.
This plant is very aggressive in the garden, and can be very difficult to eradicate once established.
Arthropod Pests
Butterfly weed ("Asclepias tuberosa", also called Canada root, Chigger flower, Chiggerflower, Fluxroot, Indian paintbrush, Indian posy, Orange milkweed, Orange Swallow-wort, Pleurisy root, Silky Swallow-wort, Tuber root, Yellow milkweed, White-root, Windroot) is a species of milkweed native to eastern North America, but also grown in gardens throughout the world for the showy flowers and the butterflies that are attracted to it.
The common name comes from the butterflies that are attracted to the plant by its color and its copious production of nectar. Butterfly weed is also the larval food plant of the Queen butterfly.
It is a perennial plant growing to 0.6–2 m (1 –2 feet) tall, with cymes of orange, yellow, or nearly red flowers which are regular, perfect, 5-parted, top of flower (“crown”) with erectly held “hoods”. Pollen is in waxy masses. Flowers are produced from early summer to early fall. The leaves are spirally arranged, lanceolate, 5–12 cm long and 2–3 cm broad, hairy, dark green above and lighter beneath. The roots are thick taproots, to 30 cm long.
The seeds, borne in elongate pods, are also an attraction due to the large, silky pappus which are blown in the wind when ripe.
The plant looks similar to the Lanceolate milkweed ("../Asclepias lanceolata/"), however the Butterfly weed is uniquely identified by the larger number of flowers and hairy stems. It is most commonly found in fields with dry soil.
In gardens, butterfly weed does best with a deep, rich, well-drained soil in full sun. In the wild it is often found in dry, sand or gravel soil, but has also been reported on stream margins.
As a border perennial or meadow plant, primarily grown to attract butterflies to the garden. Can also be grown for cut flowers. The plant is often used in children's gardens for the seeds (for making "wishes" by blowing the seeds), as well as for the caterpillars and butterflies.
Remove the forming seed pods to encourage reblooming, or leave them to develop the interesting seeds and for winter interest. Transplanting can be difficult due to the deep taptoot.
Primarily by seed, but also by division or basal cuttings.
Does well as a cut flower, but leaves should be completely removed from the stems before putting in the vase.
See "../Asclepias/" for a list of pests and diseases. Caterpillars found on this plant are usually butterfly larvae, so if butterflies are desired, leave the caterpillars be.
Tatarian Aster is a tall, upright perennial native to Asia but grown elsewhere in gardens.
The plant overall is coarse, with large leaves and thick stems. The flowers are borne in late autumn, with yellow disk florets and purple ray florets.
The species can grow up to 2.5 m (8 ft) tall, but shorter cultivars are available.
Does best in full sun. Plants tend to flop if grown in very rich soils. Hardy in USDA zones 3-8.
Generally grown as a "back of the border" plant, for its tall flowers in the fall. Excellent as a cut flower.
Cut back half-way in mid summer to encourage bushiness. The plant spreads aggressively, so will need to be reined in by digging out the outer crowns or dividing every two or three years.
The plant does not readily self-seed.
Easily divided.
Pest and disease issues are not common, though deer browsing can be a problem if deer populations are high. See ../Aster/ for discussion of pest and disease issues.
Barbarea vulgaris, also called as Bittercress, Herb Barbara, Rocketcress, Yellow Rocketcress, Winter Rocket, and Wound Rocket, is a biennial herb native to Europe.
During the autumn and winter, the plant has only a basal rosette of glossy leaves. As it bolts and flowers in the spring, it also has pinnately divided leaves arranges sparsely on the stem. The yellow flowers are borne in dense terminal clusters above the foliage in spring. It grows to about 8-32 inches.
It is naturalised in many parts of North America as a weed. Winter Cress prefers moist, disturbed fields.
Greens are edible and have a similar taste to other mustard greens, but become sour when the plant bolts.
Beauveria bassiana is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and causes disease in various insects by acting as a parasite; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, whitefly, different beetles and its use in the control of the malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation. The species is named after the Italian entomologist Agostino Bassi who discovered it in 1835 as the cause of the muscardine disease of silkworms. "Beauveria bassiana" (formerly also known as "Tritirachium shiotae") is the anamorph (the asexually reproducing form) of the fungus species "Cordyceps bassiana". The teleomorph (the sexually reproducing form) was discovered in 2001.
The disease caused by the fungus is called white muscardine disease. When spores of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate, enter the body, and grow inside, eventually killing the insect. Afterwards a white mold grows on the cadaver and produces new spores. Most insects living near the soil have evolved natural defenses against the fungus, but many other insects are susceptible.
The fungus does not appear to infect humans or other animals and is considered safe as an insecticide but the spores might cause a problem to people with breathing difficulties. The microscopic spores are typically sprayed on affected areas; the plan for malaria control is to coat mosquito nets with them.
"Beauveria bassiana" parasitizes a very wide range of arthropod hosts, and so should be considered a nonselective pesticide. It should not be applied to flowers visited by pollinating insects.
Known targets include:
"Beauveria bassiana" rapidly colonizes the host organism, killing within a matter of days, depending on ambient temperatures. Best action is achieved during warm, humid weather.
Primarily applied as an emulsified suspension (ES) or wettable powder (WP), though research is being done into using lures in order to limit exposure to non-target species.
The low selectivity of this biocontrol is cause for great concern and caution when applying. It can affect beneficial insects (such as lady beetles), and can also affect the lungs and nasal passages of mammals, including humans, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems, though the US EPA lists it as safe for human exposure, with "no expected health risks to humans."
Soil dwelling arthropods generally have resistance, as the fungus is common in soils throughout the world.
Beetles are the most diverse group of insects. Their order, Coleoptera (meaning "sheathed wing"), has more described species in it than in any other order in the animal kingdom. Forty percent of all described insect species are beetles (about 350,000 species), and new species are regularly discovered. Estimates put the total number of species, described and undescribed, at between 5 and 8 million. For this reason, the Scottish geneticist J. B. S. Haldane, when asked what his studies of nature revealed about God, replied, "An inordinate fondness for beetles."
Beetles can be found in almost all habitats, but are not known to occur in the sea or in the polar regions. They impact the ecosystem in several ways. On the one hand, they feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. On the other hand, they are prey of various animals including birds and mammals. Certain species are agricultural pests, such as the red flour beetle "../Tribolium castaneum/", the Colorado potato beetle "../Leptinotarsa decemlineata/", or the mungbean beetle "../Callosobruchus maculatus/", while others are important controls of agricultural pests. For example, ../Lady Beetles/ (family Coccinellidae) consume ../Aphids/, ../Scale Insects/, ../Thrips/, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.
The general anatomy of beetles is quite uniform, though specific organs and appendages may vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Beetle bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs arise. The abdomen, then, is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle "section" is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. Like all insects, beetles are [segmented organisms, and all three of the major sections of the body are themselves composed of several further segments, although these are not always readily discernible. This further segmentation can usually best be seen on the abdomen.
Beetles are generally characterised by a particularly hard exoskeleton, hard forewings (elytra), and chewing mouth parts. The beetle's exoskeleton is made up of numerous plates called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design creates the armoured defences of the beetle while maintaining flexibility. The elytra are not used for flight, but tend to cover the hind part of the body and protect the second pair of wings (alae). The elytra must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and, after landing, are folded, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra.
In some beetles the ability to fly has been lost, most notably in the ../Ground Beetle/s (family Carabidae) and the "true ../Weevils" (family ../Curculionidae/), but also in some desert and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many of these species have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, with the best known example being the glowworms of the family Phengodidae, in which the females are larviform throughout their lives.
Beetles have mouthparts similar to those of grasshoppers. Of these parts, the most commonly known are probably the mandibles, which appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see Defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. These are the maxillary and labial palpi.
The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, as in the case of whirligig beetles (family Gyrinidae), in which the eyes are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Other species also have divided eyes — some longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) and weevils — while many beetles have eyes that are notched to some degree. A few beetle genera also possess ocelli, which are small, simple eyes usually situated farther back on the head (on the vertex).
Beetle antennae are primarily organs of smell, but may also be used to feel out a beetle's environment physically. They may also be used in some families during mating, or among a few beetles for defence. Antennae vary greatly in form within the Coleoptera, but are often similar within any given family. In some cases, males and females of the same species will have different antennal forms. Antennae may be ( and are sub-forms of clavate, or clubbed antennae), , , , , or . For images of these antennal forms, see antenna (biology).
The legs, which are multi-segmented, end in two to five small segments called tarsi, which are vaguely comparable to feet. Like many other insect orders beetles bear claws, usually one pair, on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs may be variously modified and adapted for other uses. Among aquatic families — predacious diving beetles (Dytiscidae), crawling water beetles (Haliplidae), many water scavenger beetles (Hydrophilidae), and others — the legs, most notably the hind pair, are modified for swimming and often bear rows of long hairs to aid this purpose. Other beetles have fossorial legs that are widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and clown beetles (family Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as ../Flea Beetle/s (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), are enlarged and designed for jumping.
Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibres. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system.
Beetles have hemolymph instead of blood, and the open circulatory system of the beetle is powered by a tube-like heart attached to the top inside of the thorax.
Beetles undergo complete metamorphosis, meaning that the larval form does not resemble the adult.
A single female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime. Eggs are usually laid according to the substrate the larva will feed on upon hatching. Among others, they can be laid loose in the substrate (e.g. flour beetle), laid in clumps on leaves (e.g. Colorado potato beetle), or individually attached (e.g. mungbean beetle and other seed borers) or buried in the soil (e.g. carrot weevil).
The larva is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle lifecycle. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most metallic wood-boring beetles (family Buprestidae) and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, lady beetles, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species but can be as long as several years.
Beetle larvae can be differentiated from other insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened head, the presence of chewing mouthparts, and spiracles along the sides of the body. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles whose larvae are somewhat flattened and are highly mobile are the ground beetles, some rove beetles, and others; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the families of the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, but more commonly known as grubs.
All beetle larvae go through several instars, which are the developmental stages between each moult. In many species the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile in order to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; examples include the blister beetles (family Meloidae) and some rove beetles, particularly those of the genus "Aleochara".
As with all endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from this pupa emerges a fully formed, sexually mature adult beetle, or imago. Adults have an extremely variable lifespan, from weeks to years, depending on the species.
Beetles may display extremely intricate behaviour when mating. Smell is thought to be important in the location of a mate.
Conflict can play a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (genus "Nicrophorus") where conflicts between males and females rage until only one of each is left, thus ensuring reproduction by the strongest and fittest. Many beetles are territorial and will fiercely defend their small patch of territory from intruding males.
Pairing is generally short but in some cases will last for several hours. During pairing sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the eggs.
Parental care varies between species, ranging from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf to certain scarab beetles, which construct impressive underground structures complete with a supply of dung to house and feed their young. Other beetles are leaf rollers, biting sections of leaves to cause them to curl inwards, then laying their eggs, thus protected, inside.
Beetles and their larvae have a variety of strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity, and active defence.
Camouflage involves the use of colouration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. Among those that exhibit this defensive strategy are some of the leaf beetles (family Chysomelidae), having green colouring very similar to their habitat on plant leaves. More complex camouflage also occurs, as with some weevils, where various coloured scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung.
Another defence that often uses colour or shape to deceive potential enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear a striking resemblance to wasps, which fools predators into keeping their distance even though the beetles are in fact harmless. This defence can be found to a lesser extent in other beetle families, such as the scarab beetles. Beetles may combine their colour mimicry with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble.
Many beetle species, including ../Lady Beetle/s and ../Blister Beetle/s, can secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or even poisonous. These same species often exhibit aposematism, where bright or contrasting colour patterns warn away potential predators.
Large ground beetles and longhorn beetles may go on the attack, using their strong mandibles to forcibly persuade a predator to seek out easier prey. Others, such as bombardier beetles (within Carabidae) spray acidic gas from their abdomen to repel predators.
Besides being abundant and varied, the Coleoptera are able to exploit the wide diversity of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are generalists, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialised in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and ../Rove Beetles/ (family Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and will catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.
Decaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is consumed by coprophagous species such as certain scarab beetles (family Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous species such as the carrion beetles (family Silphidae). Some of the beetles found within dung and carrion are in fact predatory, such as the clown beetles, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects.
Aquatic beetles use several techniques for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Predaceous diving beetles hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Water scavenger beetles have hairs on their under surface that retain a layer of air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles use both their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention (Roughley 2001) while whirligig beetles simply carry a bubble down with them whenever they dive.
Many agricultural, forestry, and household insect pests are members of this order. Some of these are:
Some farmers develop w:beetle banks to foster and provide cover for beneficial beetles.
The silverleaf whitefly ("Bemisia argentifolii", formerly referred to as sweetpotato whitefly-strain B "Bemisia tabaci") is one of several whiteflies that are currently important agricultural pests. The silverleaf whitefly was first found in poinsettia crops in Florida in the mid-1980's. It was found to have moved on to tomatoes and other fruit and vegetable crops less than a year later. Within five years, the silverleaf whitefly had caused over $100 million in damage to the Texas and California agriculture industries.
The adult silverleaf whitefly is about 1 millimeter in length and pale yellow in color.
In addition to inflicting typical whitefly-type damage on plants, this species can transmit plant viruses such as geminiviruses. The broad mite ("Polyphagotarsonemus latus") also uses the whitefly as a dispersal mechanism by clinging to the legs of the fly and dropping off at another plant.
This particular pest has been shown to be a good candidate for biological pest control, as it has several natural enemies, including parasitic wasps such as "Encarsia" and "Eretmocerus".
Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry or Thunberg's Barberry) is a species of "../Berberis/", native to Japan and eastern Asia. It is widely grown as an ornamental plant, both in Japan and elsewhere in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Numerous cultivars have been selected, including plants selected for yellow, dark red to violet, or variegated foliage, erect growth, and dwarf size.
It is a densely branched, deciduous, spiny, suckering shrub which grows 1-2 (3) m high, with a "fountain-like" form when unpruned, though cultivars may be fastigiate to nearly prostrate. It has deeply grooved, brown, spiny branches with a single (occasionally tridentine) spine (actually a highly modified leaf) at each shoot node. The leaves are green to blue-green, very small, spatula to oval shaped, 12–24 mm long and 3–15 mm broad; they are produced in clusters of 2-6 on a dwarf shoot in the axil of each spine. The flowers are pale yellow, 5–8 mm diameter, produced in drooping 1-1.5 cm long umbrella-shaped clusters of 2–5; flowering is from mid spring to early summer. The fruit is a glossy bright red to orange-red, ovoid berry 7–10 mm long and 4–7 mm broad, containing a single seed. They mature during late summer and fall and persist through the winter.
It is sometimes confused with "Berberis canadensis" (American Barberry), "Berberis vulgaris" (European Barberry), and other deciduous "Berberis" species; it is most readily distinguished by the flowers being produced in umbels, not racemes.
Well-drained soils in full sun to shade.
In recent years it has become an invasive species in parts of the eastern United States; in Canada its cultivation is prohibited as the species can act as a host for "../Puccinia graminis/" (black rust), a rust disease of wheat. Currently there are breeding and selection programs aimed at producing cultivars that are either sterile or produce relatively little seed.
As specimens, hedges, or barrier plants. The flowers are an excellent nectar source.
Pruning is a rather hazardous undertaking. Fine-pruning is best done in winter, shearing better in spring when clippings can fall into the plant. Branches are somewhat fragile, so care should be taken when raking off clippings.
Readily transplants, but again transplanting is difficult due to the spines.
Self-seeds readily. Cultivars propagated by cuttings.
See "../Berberis/" for a list of pests and diseases.
Devil's beggartick ("Bidens frondosa") is an annual herb in the family Asteraceae, native to North America.
This plant is known by a variety of different names, including Bur Marigold, Devil's Bootjack, Devil's pitchfork, Pitchfork Weed, and Sticktight.
The sticky seeds make this plant a nuisance for pet and livestock owners, and it is generally seen as a weed.
It looks similar to a "Dahlia" plant, up to 2 m tall, usually with reddish stems. Its flowers are yellow, produced in early autumn, followed by numerous seeds with hooked barbs that attach onto passing animals' fur or clothing or sometimes even skin which allow the seeds to be dispersed widely.
During flowering, the plant is an autumn nectar source, though other plants should be used instead because of the seed problems.
Biocontrols for plant pathogens include organism that consume, parasitize, or are antagonistic to the pathogenic organisms.
Biocontrols that consume pathogens are generally soil organisms that use the pathogen as a nutrient source.
Parasites include fungi and bacteria that are pathogens of the pathogen.
Antagonistic organisms inhibit the pathogen by interfering with their biology.
Biocontrols for Plant Pathogens
Biocontrols for Plant Pathogens
For some weeds, particularly invasive species, biocontrols have been selected and developed as a form of passive control in natural areas. While they are rarely used in garden situations, they are sometimes employed in managing meadows or woodlands. Most weed biocontrols are insects, though certain fungi are also used for some cases.
Biocontrols are much more commonly used for management of pest animals and microorganisms.
Biological control of pests and diseases is a method of controlling pests and diseases in agriculture that relies on natural predation rather than introduced chemicals.
A key belief of the organic gardener is that biodiversity furthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable it is. The organic gardener therefore works to create a system where the insects that are sometimes called pests and the pathogens that cause diseases are not eradicated, but instead are kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances within a living and vibrant ecosystem. Contrary to more 'conventional' gardening practices which often use chemical methods to kill both useful and harmful garden life forms indiscriminately, this is a holistic approach that seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the myriad of organisms that constitute the garden fauna and flora. The organic gardener will often hold the view for example that the eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests is not only not possible, but also undesirable, for without them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon them as food or hosts would not be able to survive.
In a healthy natural woodland where there is little direct human intervention, pest and disease organisms will always be present, but, unless there is a drastic environmental change, will normally kept in a state of equilibrium where they are not able to get out of hand to a level which is detrimental to the overall woodland community. This is the model for which the sensitive organic gardener will strive, but at the same time it is wise to recognise that there will often be some degree of intervention needed to manipulate the natural checks and balances to the gardener's favour, particularly if growing plants for food or ornament which would not normally occur in natural situations. Therefore biological control is about developing a range of techniques that use living organisms to maintain the beneficial equilibria in garden landscapes without causing adverse effects to humans or the wider environment. Of course, introducing exotic insects into any ecosystem entails taking risks of moving further from the intended equilibrium through unexpected interactions.
An important part of the biological gardening approach is to become familiar with the various life forms that inhabit the garden, predators as well as pests, and also their life cycles, patterns of feeding and the habitats that they prefer.
Insects have devised many ways to eat other insects. Predators will directly attack and devour their prey, whilst parasitoids will deposit an egg within another insects body, from which a larva will emerge which will devour the host's innards.
ladybugs, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July, are voracious predators of aphids, and will also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The ladybird is a very familiar beetle with red and black markings, whilst its larvae are initially small and spidery, growing up to 17 mm long. It has a tapering segmented grey/black body with orange/yellow markings nettles in the garden and by leaving hollow stems and some plant debris over-winter so that they can hibernate over winter.
../Hoverflies/ are another very welcome garden predator. Resembling slightly darker bees or wasps, they have characteristic hovering, darting flight patterns. There are over 100 species of hoverfly whose larvae principally feed upon greenfly, one larva devouring up to fifty a day, or 1000 in its lifetime. They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars. Adults feed on nectar and pollen, which they require for egg production. Eggs are minute (1 mm), pale yellow white and laid singly near greenfly colonies. Larvae are 8–17 mm long, disguised to resemble bird droppings, they are legless and have no distinct head. Semi-transparent in a range of colours from green, white, brown and black.
Hoverflies can be encouraged by growing attractant flowers such as the poached egg plant "(../Limnanthes douglasii/)", marigolds or phacelia throughout the growing season.
../Dragonflies/ are important predators of mosquitoes, both in the water, where the dragonfly nyads eat mosquito larvae, and in the air, where adult dragonflies capture and eat adult mosquitoes. Community-wide mosquito control programs that spray adult mosquitoes also kill dragonflies, thus removing an important biocontrol agent, and can actually increase mosquito populations in the long term.
Other useful garden predators include lacewings, anthrocorid bugs, rove and ground beetles, aphid midge, centipedes, predatory mites, as well as megafauna such as frogs, toads, hedgehogs, slow-worms and birds. Cats and rat terriers kill field mice, rats, June bugs, and birds. Dogs chase away many types of pest animals. Dachshunds are bred specifically to fit inside tunnels underground to kill gophers and rabbits.
A diverse range of wasps lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing wasps. Parasitic wasps take much longer than predators to consume their victims, for if the larvae were to eat too fast they would run out of food before they became adults. Such parasites are very useful in the organic garden, for they are very efficient hunters, always at work searching for pest invaders. As adults they require high energy fuel as they fly from place to place, and feed upon nectar, pollen and sap, therefore planting plenty of flowering plants, particularly buckwheat, umbellifers and composites will encourage their presence.
Three of the most important groups are;
Choosing a diverse range of plants for the garden can help to regulate pests in a variety of ways, including;
Acting as trap plants by providing an alluring food that entices pests away from crops.
The following are plants often used in vegetable gardens to deter insects 
Most of the biological controls listed above depend on providing incentives in order to 'naturally' attract beneficial insects to the garden. However there are occasions when biological controls can be directly introduced. Common biocontrol agents include parasitoids, predators, pathogens or weed feeders. This is particularly appropriate in situations such as the greenhouse, a largely artificial environment, and are usually purchased by mail order.
Some biocontrol agents that can be introduced include;
Biological control proves to be very successful economically, and even when the method has been less successful, it still produces a benefit-to-cost ratio of 11:1. One study has estimated that a successful biocontrol program returns £32 in benefits for each £1 invested in developing and implementing the program, i.e., a 32:1 benefit-to-cost ratio. The same study had shown that an average chemical pesticide program only returned profits in the ratio of 2.5:1.
Blight refers to a specific symptom that can be expressed by plants in response to infection by a plant pathogenic organism. It is simply a rapid and complete chlorosis, browning, then death of plant tissues such as leaves, branches, twigs, or floral organs. Accordingly, many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called blights. Several notable examples are:
On leaf tissue, symptoms of blight are characterized by the initial appearance of lesions which rapidly engulf surrounding tissue. However, lesions of diseases that cause leaf spots may, in advanced stages, expand to kill entire areas of leaf tissue and thus exhibit blight symptoms.
Blights








The Japanese Honeysuckle ("Lonicera japonica"; Suikazura 水鬘 or スイカズラ in Japanese) is a species of honeysuckle native to eastern Asia including Japan, Korea, northern and eastern China, and Taiwan.
It is a twining vine able to climb to 10 m high or more in trees, with opposite, simple oval leaves 3–8 cm long and 2–3 cm broad. The flowers are double tongued, white to yellow, and sweetly scented. The fruit is a globose dark blue berry 5–8 mm diameter containing numerous seeds.
Japanese Honeysuckle has become an invasive exotic weed in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand and much of the United States, including Hawaii, as well as a number of Pacific and Caribbean islands. It is classified as a noxious weed in several US states, including Illinois and Virginia. It has done severe damage to eastern American woodlands, often forming vast colonies on forest floors that displace virtually all native ground plants, and climbing into trees and shrubs and severely weakening and even killing them by cutting off sap flow and shading their leaves. Scientists and conservationists have suspected for some time now that it releases allelopathic chemicals into the ground, inhibiting the growth of other plants .
Nonetheless, this species is still sold by American nurseries, often as the cultivar 'Hall's Prolific'. It is an effective groundcover, and does have pleasant, strong-smelling flowers, but the damage it does far outweighs any positive qualities. The only invasive exotics that compete with this plant for total damage done in the eastern United States are ../Kudzu/ and ../Multiflora Rose/.
The Japanese Honeysuckle flower is of high medicinal value in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is called rěn dōng téng (忍冬藤) or jīn yín huā (金銀花; lit. "gold silver flower"). It has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and is used to dispel heat and remove toxins, including carbuncles, fevers, influenza and ulcers. It is, however, of cold and yin nature, and should not be taken by anyone with weak and "cold" digestive system. In Korean, it is called "geumeunhwa". The dried leaves are also used in traditional Chinese medicine.
Lonicera maackii (Amur Honeysuckle or Bush Honeysuckle) is a species of honeysuckle in the family Caprifoliaceae, native to temperate Asia in northern and western China (south to Yunnan), Mongolia, Japan (central and northern Honshū, rare), Korea, and southeastern Russia (Primorsky Krai). It is listed as an endangered species in Japan. It has escaped from cultivation and become naturalised in New Zealand and the eastern United States; in the forests of the latter, it has become an important invasive species.
The common name Amur Honeysuckle comes from the Amur River which is the world's eighth longest river. This river forms the border between the Russian Far East and Manchuria in China. L. maackii is native to the area surrounding this river. The species name maackii is derived from Richard Maack, a 19th century Russian naturalist.
It is a deciduous large shrub growing to 6 m tall with stems up to 10 cm diameter. The leaves are oppositely arranged, 5–9 cm long and 2–4 cm broad, with an entire margin, and with at least some rough hairs on them. The flowers are produced in pairs, commonly with several pairs grouped together in clusters; they are 2 cm long, two-lipped, white later turning yellow or light orange in colour; flowering is from mid spring to early summer. The fruit is a bright red to black semi-translucent berry 2–6 mm diameter containing numerous small seeds; they ripen in autumn, and are eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings. It is fast growing and favours shady habitats such as the forest understory, neglected urban areas, and fence rows. It can form extremely dense thickets.
It is grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive flowers, and also as a hedge. A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use, including 'Erubescens' with pink flowers, and 'Rem Red' with erect habit.
The flowers are sometimes used by children, who remove the blossom by hand, and pull off the bottom to suck out the sweet nectar in the centre. The red berries are mildly poisonous to humans and should not be eaten.
Spread of this plant is illegal or controlled in some areas of the United States due to its well documented invasive character. It is listed as a "invasive, banned" species in Connecticut, "prohibited" in Massachusetts, and a "Class B noxious weed" in Vermont. It is also officially listed as an invasive species by government agencies in Wisconsin and Tennessee.
This plant is adaptable and successful in a wide range of conditions. In the United States, Amur honeysuckle was once planted to control erosion, and as hedges. It spread quickly as birds dispersed the seeds, and was soon naturalised. Notably, in deciduous forest understories of the eastern United States it forms dense growths with thick canopies that shade out native shrubs, young trees, and wild flowers. Uncontrolled, these growths create a near monoculture of Amur Honeysuckle. This species poses a serious threat not only to the diversity of the ecosystems which they invade but also to forest regeneration itself.
Due to the invasive nature of this species and the ecological threat it possess it may be inadvisable to cultivate this plant in climates similar to those found where this species has become invasive (e.g. eastern United States). It has been suggested that existing specimens found outside of their native range in east Asia should be removed and replaced with alternative non-invasive species. Possible alternative fast growing, shade tolerant, deciduous shrubs include "../Calycanthus floridus/", "../Cornus mas/", "../Cornus sericea/", "../Forsythia/" hybrids, "../Hydrangea/" spp., "../Syringa vulgaris/", "../Viburnum cassinoides/", "../Viburnum dentatum/", "../Viburnum dilatatum/", "../Viburnum opulus/" , "../Viburnum prunifolium/", "../Viburnum trilobum/", "../Weigela florida/".
Honeysuckle can be controlled by cutting, flaming, or burning the plant to root level and repeating on two-week increments until nutrient reserves in the roots are depleted. To ensure eradication newly cut stumps should be treated with herbicide. Control through prescribed burning has been found to be most effective during the seed dispersal phase (late summer, early fall). Honeysuckle can also be controlled through annual applications of glyphosate which thoroughly soak the leaves, or through grubbing of the shallowly rooted young plants. Both of these methods are only practical if high labour costs and soil damage are not of concern.
The Privet Honeysuckle is a low-growing evergreen shrub or groundcover, useful for planting on banks or other areas due to its low maintenance needs.
This is a low, spreading shrub with an arching habit and "fishbone-like" leaves and secondary branches. The leaves are small, simple, shiny dark green. The small white flowers are borne in the axils in pairs, and while they are not showy they do attract hummingbirds.
Does best in well-drained soils. May require some shelter in the colder part of the range.
The arching habit makes it a good candidate for growing over walls or on steep banks. Layers readily and spreads fairly quickly. 
The branches are also useful for floral arrangements.
Very easy. Can outgrow its space, but easily reined in.
../Layering/ is the most common method.
Problems are rare in the garden. Occasionally browsed by deer, but grows back readily. See ../Lonicera/ for a full discussion of pests and diseases affecting the genus.
The Tarnished Plant Bug is a serious pest of both food crops and ornamentals, with a wide range of hosts and capable of causing considerable damage.
Buds and terminal branches often become yellowed, wilted, or aborted due to heavy sap feeding.
Affected genera include but are not limited to the following:
The gypsy moth, "Lymantria dispar", is a moth in the family Lymantriidae of Eurasian origin. Originally ranging from Europe to Asia, it was introduced to North America in the late 1860s, where it has been expanding its range ever since.
The hatching of gypsy moth eggs coincides with budding of most hardwood trees. Larvae emerge from egg masses from early spring through mid-May.
Gypsy moths are dispersed in two ways. Natural dispersal occurs when newly hatched larvae hanging from host trees on silken threads are carried by the wind for a distance of up to about 1 mile, although most go less than 50 meters. Eggs can be carried for longer distances. Artificial dispersal occurs when people transport gypsy moth eggs thousands of miles from infested areas on cars and recreational vehicles, firewood, household goods, and other personal possessions. Females are flightless in most varieties, so these are the only means of spread.
The effects of defoliation depend primarily on the amount of foliage that is removed, the condition of the tree at the time it is defoliated, the number of consecutive defoliations, available soil moisture, and the species of host.
If less than 50 percent of their crown is defoliated, most hardwoods will experience only a slight reduction (or loss) in radial growth.
If more than 50 percent of their crown is defoliated, most hardwoods will refoliate or produce a second flush of foliage by midsummer. Healthy trees can usually withstand one or two consecutive defoliations of greater than 50 percent. Trees that have been weakened by previous defoliation or been subjected to other stresses such as droughts are frequently killed after a single defoliation of more than 50 percent.
Trees use energy reserves during refoliation and are eventually weakened. Weakened trees exhibit symptoms such as dying back of twigs and branches in the upper crown and sprouting of old buds on the trunk and larger branches. Weakened trees experience radial growth reduction of approximately 30 to 50 percent.
Trees weakened by consecutive defoliations are also vulnerable to attack by disease organisms and other insects. For example, the Armillaria fungus attacks the roots, and the two-lined chestnut borer attacks the trunk and branches. Affected trees will eventually die 2 or 3 years after they are attacked.
Although not preferred by the larvae, pines and hemlocks are subject to heavy defoliation during gypsy moth outbreaks and are more likely to be killed than hardwoods. A single, complete defoliation can kill approximately 50 percent of the pines and 90 percent of the mature hemlocks. This is because conifers do not store energy in their roots; an exception is larch.
Larvae develop into adults by going through a series of progressive moults through which they increase in size. Instars are the stages between each molt. Male larvae normally go through five instars (females, go through six) before entering the pupal stage. Newly hatched larvae are black with long hair-like setae. Older larvae have five pairs of raised blue spots and six pairs of raised brick-red spots along their backs, and a sprinkling of setae.
During the first three instars, larvae remain in the top branches or crowns of host trees. The first stage or instar chews small holes in the leaves. The second and third instars feed from the outer edge of the leaf toward the center.
When population numbers are sparse, the movement of the larvae up and down the tree coincides with light intensity. Larvae in the fourth instar feed in the top branches or crown at night. When the sun comes up, larvae crawl down the trunk of the tree to rest during daylight hours. Larvae hide under flaps of bark, in crevices, or under branches - any place that provides protection. When larvae hide underneath leaf litter, mice, shrews, and "Calosoma" beetles can prey on them. At dusk, when the sun sets, larvae climb back up to the top branches of the host tree to feed.
When population numbers are dense, however, larvae feed continuously day and night until the foliage of the host tree is stripped. Then they crawl in search of new sources of food.
The larvae reach maturity between mid-June and early July. They enter the pupal stage. This is the stage during which larvae change into adults or moths. Pupation lasts from 7 to 14 days. When the population is spread out and running low, pupation can take place under flaps of bark, in crevices, under branches, on the ground, and in other places where larvae rested. During periods when population numbers are dense, pupation is not restricted to locations where larvae rested. Pupation will take place in sheltered and non-sheltered locations, even exposed on the trunks of trees or on foliage of nonhost trees. Sometimes the caterpillars create flimsy cocoons made of silk strands holding the leaf together, while others do not cover their pupae in cocoons, but rather hang from a twig or tree bark, like butterfly pupae do.
The brown male gypsy moth emerges first, flying in rapid zigzag patterns searching for females. The male gypsy moths are diurnal unlike most moths, which are nocturnal. When heavy, black-and-white egg-laden females emerge, they emit a chemical substance called a pheromone that attracts the males. The female lays her eggs in July and August close to the spot where she pupated. Then, both adult gypsy moths die. The European and most Russian forms of the gypsy moth have flightless females. Although they have large wings, the musculature is not developed. However, the Japanese gypsy moth females do fly and are attracted to lights. During outbreaks they have been known to fly to ships in port and lay their eggs on the ships.
The egg is the overwintering stage. After an acclimation stage, eggs can withstand freezing temperatures. The longer they are chilled in winter, the less heating is required for their hatch in spring.
Gypsy moth egg masses are typically laid on branches and trunks of trees, but egg masses may be found in any sheltered location. Egg masses are buff colored when first laid but may bleach out over the winter months when exposed to direct sunlight and weathering. As the female lays them, she covers them with hair-like setae from her abdomen. Many individuals find these hairs irritating, and they may offer the eggs some protection. Egg masses contain from a couple of hundred to about 1200 eggs.
The gypsy moth was introduced into the United States in 1868 by a French scientist, Leopold Trouvelot, living in Medford, Massachusetts, who enjoyed raising many types of caterpillars including silkworms. It is now one of the most notorious pests of hardwood trees in the Eastern United States. The first outbreak there occurred in 1889. By 1987, the gypsy moth had established itself throughout the Northeast USA and southern Quebec and Ontario. The insect has spread south into Virginia and West Virginia, and west into Michigan and Wisconsin. Infestations have also occurred sporadically in Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, and British Columbia.
Since 1980, the gypsy moth has defoliated over 1,000,000 acres (4,000 km²) of forest each year. In 1981, a record 12,900,000 acres (52,200 km²) were defoliated. This is an area larger than Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut combined.
In wooded suburban areas, during periods of infestation when trees are visibly defoliated, gypsy moth larvae crawl up and down walls, across roads, over outdoor furniture, and even inside homes. During periods of feeding they leave behind a mixture of small pieces of leaves and frass, or excrement. During outbreaks, the sound of chewing and frass dropping is a continual annoyance.
Gypsy moth populations usually remain at very low levels but occasionally populations increase to very high levels which can result in partial to total defoliation of host trees for 1-3 years.
Gypsy moth larvae prefer oaks, but may feed on several hundred different species of trees and shrubs, both hardwood and conifer. In the East the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, speckled alder, basswood, gray and paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorn, although other species are also affected. The list of hosts will undoubtedly expand as the insect spreads south and west. The gypsy moth avoids ash, tulip-tree, American sycamore, butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, arborvitae, American holly, and shrubs such as mountain laurel and rhododendron, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high. Older larvae feed on several species of hardwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and the pines and spruces native to the East.
Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant belonging to the loosestrife family, ../Lythraceae/, native to the wetlands of Eurasia, but growing in other parts of the world as an invasive plant. Other names include spiked loosestrife, purple lythrum, or salicaire. It should not be confused with other plants sharing the name "loosestrife" that are members of the family Primulaceae.
It is a herbaceous perennial plant, growing 1-2 m tall, forming clonal colonies 1.5 m or more in width with numerous erect stems growing from a single woody root mass. The stems are reddish-purple and somewhat square in cross-section. The leaves are lanceolate, 3-10 cm long and 1-2 cm broad, downy and sessile, and arranged opposite or in whorls of three. The flowers are reddish purple, 10-15 mm diameter, with six petals (occasionally five), and are clustered tightly in the axils of bracts or leaves. The fruit is a small 3-4 mm capsule containing numerous minute seeds. Flowering lasts throughout the summer. When the seeds are mature, the leaves often turn bright red through dehydration in early autumn; the red colour may last for almost two weeks. The dead stalks from previous growing seasons are brown, generally remaining erect through the winter months.
Purple loosestrife has become an invasive species since its introduction into temperate New Zealand and North America and is now considered a noxious weed in many regions. The seeds may have arrived in the plant's non-native areas in muddy ballast water emptied from ships, but has also been used as a medicinal herb and cultivated as a garden plant. The flowers are quite showy and bright, and monotypic fields of purple loosestrife are attractive, however purple loosestrife has had a very destructive impact on North American wetland ecology since its arrival in the early 19th century. 
The plants grow vigorously and spread very fast when removed from their natural controlling agents. Infestations result in dramatic disruption in water flow in rivers and canals, and a sharp decline in biological diversity. Native food and cover plant species, notably cattails, are completely crowded out, which may be disruptive to the life cycles of other organisms such as waterfowl, amphibians, or algae. 
In North America, purple loosestrife may be distinguished from similar native plants (e.g. fireweed "../Epilobium angustifolium/", blue vervain "../Verbena hastata/", Liatris "../Liatris/" spp., and spiraea "../Spiraea douglasii/") by its angular stalks which are square in outline, as well by it leaves, which are in pairs that alternate at right angle and are not serrated.
A single plant may produce up to three million tiny seeds annually. Easily carried by wind and water, the seeds germinate in moist soils after overwintering. The plant can also sprout anew from pieces of root left in the soil or water. Once established, infestations are extremely difficult and costly to remove by mechanical and chemical means. 
Purple loosestrife provides a model of successful biological pest control. Research began in 1985 and today the plant is managed well with a number of insects that feed on it. Four species of beetle use purple loosestrife as their natural food source and they can do significant damage to the plant. The beetles used as biological control agents include two species of leaf beetle and two species of weevil.
Outside of wetland areas, Purple Loosestrife is not particularly aggressive, and its long bloom period makes it an excellent garden plant. It should be handled with care however, and not planted where seeds might be washed into watersheds (including storm sewers). Composts made from materials including this plant should likewise be kept well away from wetland areas.
"European wand loosestrife" ("L. virgatum") is the same species, and the plant often appears under this name in nurseries. The sale of purple loosestrife is illegal in many areas due to the risk of introducing seed into uninvaded wetlands.
The flowers are long lived in the vase, and can be grown in cutting gardens for this purpose.
When growing in a wetland, Purple Loostrife is a serious issue, and very hard to control due to the delicate nature of wetland environments. Heavy equipment and most herbicides should "never" be used in wetland areas. For infestations too serious to control using mowing or pulling, gardeners and horticulturists alike should consider seeking help from a wetland specialist.
The Aster Leafhopper is a small Hopper that feeds on a wide range of hosts, primarily in the Composite family, ../Asteraceae/.
Green with bright red stripes.
Stippling from feeding, but more importantly vectoring ../Aster Yellows/.
A maggot is the larval stage of the fly life cycle, though sometimes "maggot" is used to refer to the larval stage of any insect. Many maggots feed on carrion and other wastes, but some are crop pests and others are predators and parasites.
Maggots are generally 4 to 12 mm in length depending on their stage of growth. Most maggots range from an off-white color to a light brown, though some can be a yellow or reddish color. Maggots have one pair of tiny hook-like parts to aid in feeding and have no legs.
The adults are easily recognized since this is the only order of insects that has only one pair of wings ("Diptera" meaning 2 wings).
Pest maggots can be leaf or root feeders, borers, or leaf miners.
The fly life cycle is composed of four stages: egg, larva (commonly known as a maggot), pupa, and adult. Most feeding is done in the maggot stage.
For large scale raised beds (for small farm and nursery operations), raised beds are most efficiently made using tractors.

The Eastern Tent Caterpillar ("Malacosoma americanum") is a social species of caterpillar that forms communal nests in the branches of trees. It is sometimes confused with the gypsy moth ("../Lymantria dispar/"), or the fall webworm and may be erroneously referred to as a bagworm which is the common name applied to unrelated caterpillars in the family Psychidae. The moths oviposit almost exclusively on trees in the plant family Rosaceae, particularly cherries (Prunus) and apple (Malus). The caterpillars are hairy with areas of blue, white, black and orange. The blue and white colors are mechanical colors created by the selective filtering of light by microtubules that arise on the cuticle.
In terms of complexity of interactions, the eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum, stands near the pinnacle of caterpillar sociality. The adult moth lays her eggs in a single batch in late spring or early summer. The egg masses contain on average 200-300 eggs. Embryogenesis proceeds rapidly and within three weeks fully formed caterpillars can be found within the eggs. But the small caterpillars lie quiescent until the following spring, chewing their way through the shells of their eggs just as the buds of the host tree begins to expand.
The newly hatched caterpillars initiate the construction of a silk tent soon after emerging. They typically aggregate at the tent site for the whole of their larval life, expanding the tent each day to accommodate their increasing size. Under field conditions, the caterpillars feed three times each day, just before dawn, in the evening after sunset, and at mid afternoon. During each bout of feeding the caterpillars emerge from the tent, add silk to the structure, move to distant feeding sites en masse, feed, then return immediately to the tent where they rest until the next activity period. The exception to this pattern occurs in the last instar when the caterpillars feed only at night. The caterpillars lay down pheromone trails to guide their movements between the tent and feeding sites. The insect has six larval instars. When fully grown, the caterpillars disperse and construct cocoons in protected places. The adults emerge about two weeks later. Mating and oviposition typically occur on the same day as the moths emerge from their cocoons and being completely spent the females die soon thereafter.
The tent of the eastern tent caterpillar is among the largest built by any tent caterpillar. The tents are constructed in the crotch of the host tree and are typically oriented so that the broadest face of the structure faces the southeast, taking advantage of the morning sun. The caterpillars typically add silk to the structure at the onset of each of their daily activity periods. Silk is added directly to the surface of the tent as the caterpillars walk back and forth over the structure. The silk is laid down under slight tension and it eventually contracts, causing the newly spun layer of silk to separate from the previously spun layer. The tent thus consists of discrete layers separated by gaps within which the caterpillars rest. The tent has openings that allow the caterpillars to enter and exit the structure. Openings are formed where branches jut from the structure but are most common at the apex of the tent.
Light has a great effect on the caterpillars while they are spinning and they always spin the majority of their silk on the most illuminated face of the tent. Indeed, if under experimental conditions the dominant light source is directed at the tent from below, the caterpillars will build their tent upside down. Caterpillars continue to expand their tent until they enter the last phase of their larval life. The sixth-instar caterpillar conserves its silk for cocoon construction and adds nothing to the tent. The tents are multifunctional. They facilitate basking, offer some protection from enemies, provide for secure purchase, and act as a staging site from which the caterpillars launch en masse forays to distant feeding sites. The elevated humidity inside the tent may facilitate molting.
Eastern tent caterpillars are among the earliest of caterpillars to appear in the spring. Because the early spring weather is often cold, the caterpillars rely on the heat of the sun to elevate their body temperatures to levels that allow them to digest their food. Studies show that below 15°C (59°F) the caterpillars are unable to process the food in their guts. Early instars of the tent caterpillar are black and their bodies readily absorb the rays of the sun. When basking, the caterpillars typically pack together tightly, reducing heat loss due to convective currents. The long setae that occur on the caterpillars also serve to stem convective heat loss. The caterpillars may aggregate on the surface of the tent or within the structure. The tents act as miniature glass houses, trapping the heat of the morning sun and allowing the caterpillars to warm more quickly than they would if they remained outside the tent. Studies have shown that basking, aggregated caterpillars can achieve temperature excesses of as much as 44°C. Indeed, the caterpillars can easily overheat and they must take evasive action when they become too hot.
Because of its layered structure, the tent is thermally heterogeneous and the caterpillars can adjust their temperature by moving from layer to layer. The caterpillars may also aggregate on the outside of the shaded side of the tent and hang from the tips of their abdomens to enhance convective heat loss and cooling.
As shown for some other caterpillars, eastern tent caterpillars are capable of generating a small amount of metabolic heat while they digest their meals. When recently fed caterpillars pack tightly together, the temperature of the caterpillars in the interior of the mass may be several degrees Celsius above ambient temperature even in the absence of a radiant heat source. It is unclear whether this small heat gain has a significant effect on the rate of caterpillar growth.
Tent caterpillars, like many other species of social caterpillars, vigorously thrash the anterior part of their bodies when they detect predators and parasitoids. Such bouts of thrashing, which may be initiated by a single caterpillar, radiate rapidly though the colony and may result in group displays involving dozens of caterpillars. Such displays create a moving target for tachinid flies, wasps and other small parasitoids that lay their eggs on or in the body of the caterpillar. They also clearly deter stink bugs and other timid predators. Groups of caterpillars resting on the surface of the tent constitute aposematic displays. Few birds other than the cuckoo find the hairy caterpillars palatable. The leaves of the cherry tree are cyanogenic and the caterpillars regurgitate cyanide ladened juices when disturbed.
Tent caterpillars secrete silk from a spinneret wherever they go and frequently used pathways soon bear conspicuous silk trails. As the caterpillars move about the tree, they largely confine their movements to these trails. Curiously, it is not the silk that they follow but a trail pheromone secreted from the posterior tip of their abdomen. Caterpillars deposit exploratory trails by dragging the tip of their abdomen as they move over the tree in search of food. Caterpillars that find food and feed overmark the exploratory trails they follow back to the tent, creating recruitment trails. Recruitment trails are much more attractive to the caterpillars than exploratory trails and they serve to lead hungry caterpillars directly to the newest food finds. It is possible for a single successful forager to recruit the entire colony to its food find.
The exact identity of the trail pheromone of the eastern tent caterpillar has not yet been determined but the chemical 5β-cholestane-3-one has been shown to be fully competitive with the authentic trail pheromone. Caterpillars readily follow trails of this chemical, even abandoning their own trails in favor of artificial trails prepared with the compound.
The eastern tent caterpillar is of some importance as a plant pest since it may defoliate ornamental trees. Defoliated trees, however, rarely suffer significant damage and typically refoliate within several weeks. More seriously, the caterpillar has been implicated in mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS), but the exact mechanism by which the caterpillar triggers abortion in horses has yet to be determined.
Symptoms include severe defoliation of the host plant. The sign is the easily recognizable tents made by the colonies.
This is the style manual for Horticulture.
For ease of linking, this book uses a flat structure. All chapters should thus be of the form Horticulture/CHAPTER, not Horticulture/Chapter/PAGE.
By using the flat structure, links from chapter to chapter can be easily made using the form ../CHAPTER/.
There are several subcategories of this book, arranged hierarchically. The Main Category should include only the subcategories, the main page and new pages that don't seem to fit into any of the current categories, or that have not yet had appropriate page templates added to them. Any new subcategories should be placed in :, only the main page should be in the main category. For ease of use categories should sort subpages alphabetically using |Manual of Style to give for example Manual of Style.
The current list of categories is as follows. Further indented categories are subcategories of the main ones:
Images should be uploaded to commons, rather than to wikibooks, since this book cross-links with wikipedia, wikiversity, and other projects.
Since this book is intended to be printable, avoid thumbnails except in galleries. For best print quality, make images at least 300px.
Plant profiles should:
The plant pages use templates to provide structure and consistency. Most of the plant profiles are based on transwikis from Wikipedia using the Import tool. After an article is transwikied and moved to Horticulture, adding  to the top of the page (generally just before the "taxobox") and remove any categories or interwiki links at the bottom of the page.
Additional templates are used to identify specific types of plants and other things grown. See Horticulture/Using Templates for more information.
The Pest and disease lists are compiled from various source materials, including sources on the plants themselves, as well as sources on the pests and diseases themselves. These lists can be kept up-to-date using the What links here page (on the sidebar).
The early lists are from a donated website, "Johnny's Plant Profiles", which was hosted by from 2000 through 2005. These lists were compiled for the purpose of databasing to find alternate hosts (including both garden plants and weeds) as part of an organic IPM program, and that databasing approach has been used as part of building this book as well (using to find the most linked pests and diseases.
The weakness of these lists is that they assume a very high level of knowledge about the individual pests and diseases, since it lists only the pest organisms, rather than the symptoms of any given pest or disease problem. For this reason, these should eventually be replaced by troubleshooting sections (see below).
Troubleshooting sections will be like keys for using symptoms to provide causes and treatments.
External links on the module page should be avoided, unless used as references. External link sections from transwikis should for the most part be deleted. Linking to external sites on the talk page is usually acceptable if used in order to alert authors to more information that might be included or where questions can be asked (web forums, etc.).
Links to nurseries and local services should never be included under any circumstances.
Links to commercial websites about specific garden products should be included only on pages directly discussing that product.
This book uses a Neutral Point of View, so several things need to be kept in mind.
Information about the plant other than garden-related issues is encouraged, but "how-to" information outside the scope of horticulture should be discussed in other books. 
Matricaria discoidea, commonly known as pineapple weed is an annual plant native to North America and NE Asia but which has become a cosmopolitan weed. According to ITIS the specific name is "Matricaria discoidea" DC, but many synonyms are in the literature, including "M. matricarioides", "M. suaveolens", and "Chamomilla suaveolens".
The flower head is cone-shaped, composed of dense-packed yellowish-green corollas, and lacking ray-florets. The leaves are pinnately dissected and sweet-scented when crushed. The plant grows 3 to 12 inches (7.5 - 30 cm) high.
The plant grows well in disturbed areas, especially those with poor, compacted soil. It can be seen blooming on footpaths, roadsides, and similar places in spring and early summer. In the USA, it can be found from central Alaska down to California and all the way to Maine.
The flowers exude a chamomile/pineapple aroma when crushed. They are edible and have been used in salads (although they may become bitter by the time the plant blooms) and to make a herbal tea .
Pineapple weed has been used for medicinal purposes, including for relief of gastrointestinal upset, infected sores, fevers, and postpartum anemia .
Mealybug is the common name of insects in Pseudococcidae, a family of unarmored ../Scale Insects/ found in moist, warm climates. They feed on plant juices of greenhouse plants, house plants and some outdoor plants.
Mealybugs are sexually dimorphic, meaning that the sexes have distinct morphological differences. Females are nymphal, exhibit reduced morphology, and are wingless. The females do not change completely and are likely to be neotonic (exhibiting nymphal characteristics). Males are winged and do change completely during their lives. Since mealybugs (as well as all other Hemiptera) are hemimetabolous insects, they do not undergo complete metamorphosis in the true sense of the word. I.e. there are no clear larval, pupal and adult stages, and the wings do not develop internally. However, male mealybugs do exhibit a radical change during their life cycle, changing from wingless, ovoid nymphs to "wasp-like" flying adults.
Large infestations may induce leaf drop.
Mealybug females feed on plant sap, normally in roots or other crevices. They attach themselves to the plant and secrete a powdery wax layer (therefore the name mealybug) used for protection while they suck the plant juices. The males on the other hand, are short-lived as they do not feed at all as adults and only live to fertilize the females. Male citrus mealy bugs fly to the females and resemble fluffy gnats.
Some species of mealybug lay their eggs in the same waxy layer used for protection in quantities of 50–100; other species are born directly from the female.
The most serious pests are mealybugs that feed on citrus; other species damage sugarcane, grapes, pineapple (Jahn et al. 2003), coffee trees, cassava, ferns, and orchids. Mealybugs only tend to be serious pests in the presences of ants because the ants protect them from predators and parasites. Mealybugs also infest some species of carnivorous plant such as "../Sarracenia/" (pitcher plants), in such cases it is difficult to eradicate them without repeated applications of insecticide such as ../Diazinon/. .
Lemon balm ("Melissa officinalis")is a perennial herb in the mint family Lamiaceae, native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region.
It grows to 70-150 cm tall. The leaves have a lemon scent and taste. At the end of the summer, little white flowers full of nectar appear. These attract bees, hence the genus name "Melissa" (Greek for 'honey bee'). Its flavour comes from the terpenes citronellal, citronellol, citral, and geraniol. Lemon Balm grows in clumps and spreads vegetatively as well as by seed. In mild temperate zones, the stems of the plant die off at the start of the winter, but shoot up again in spring. 
This herb can be easy to cultivate in United States Department of Agriculture Plant Hardiness Zones 4 to 9. In zone 4, it needs winter mulch and a well-drained sandy soil to survive. In zone 7, it can be harvested through late autumn. It is moderately shade-tolerant, much more so than most herbs. In dry climates, it grows best in partial shade.
It is used as a flavouring in tisane and ice cream, but its most common use is to make herbal teas. It makes a particularly refreshing iced tea, especially when mixed with other herbs such as spearmint. It is also often paired with fruit dishes or candies.
Lemon balm essential oil is very popular in aromatherapy. The essential oil is commonly co-distilled with lemon oil, citronella oil, or other oils.
The crushed leaves, when rubbed on the skin, are used as a repellant for mosquitos.
Lemon Balm is also used medicinally as a herbal tea, or in extract form. It is claimed to have antibacterial, antiviral properties, and it is also used as a mild sedative or calming agent. At least one study has found it to be effective at reducing stress, although the study's authors call for further research. Its antibacterial properties have also been demonstrated scientifically, although they are markedly weaker than those from a number of other plants studied.
It can be easily grown from stem cuttings rooted in water, or from seeds. Under ideal conditions, it will seed itself prolifically and can become a nuisance in gardens.
Harvest fresh, using the leaves. 
"Metarhizium anisopliae" (also known as "Entomophthora anisopliae" in the early 1900s) was named after the insect species it was originally isolated from, the beetle "Anisoplia austriaca". It is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and causes disease in various insects by acting as a parasite; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is a mitosporic fungus with asexual reproduction for which a teleomorph has not yet been discovered. "Cordyceps taii" was shown to be the teleomorph of "Metarhizium taii", so it seems likely that the one of "M. anisopliae" will also turn out to be a "Cordyceps" species. However, it is also possible that some, if not most, strains of "M. anisopliae" have lost the capability of reproducing sexually.
Metarhizium anisopliae is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as ../Grasshoppers/, ../Termites/, ../Thrips/, ../catterpillers/ ..aphids/ etc. and its use in the control of malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.
The disease caused by the fungus is called green muscardine disease because of the green color of its spores. When these mitotic (asexual) spores (properly called conidia) of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate and the hyphae that emerge penetrate the cuticle. The fungus then develops inside the body eventually killing the insect after a few days; this lethal effect is very likely aided by the production of insecticidal cyclic peptides (destruxins). The cuticle of the cadaver often becomes red. If the ambient humidity is high enough, a white mold then grows on the cadaver that soon turns green as spores are produced. 
The microscopic spores are typically sprayed on affected areas; the plan for malaria control is to coat mosquito nets or cotton sheets attached to the wall with them. The level of insect control (mortality) in general depends on factors like the number of spores applied against the insect host, the fungus strain used, the formulation and weather conditions. Oil-based formulations allow the application of fungal spores under dry conditions.
The fungus does not appear to infect humans or other animals and is considered safe as an insecticide.
Most insects living near the soil have evolved natural defenses against entomopathogenic fungi like "M. anisopliae". This fungus is therefore locked in an evolutionary battle to overcome these defenses, which has led to a large number of strains that are adapted to certain groups of insects. Some strains are so specific that they have attained variety status, like "Metarhizium anisopliae" var. "acridum", which almost exclusively infects grasshoppers in the suborder Caelifera of the Orthoptera.
Micro-biocontrols are organisms that can be employed by gardeners to control garden pests and plant diseases.
Mites, together with ../Ticks/, belong to the subclass Acarina (also known as Acari) and the class Arachnida. Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all the invertebrate groups. They have exploited an incredible array of habitats, and because of their small size (some are microscopic) most go totally unnoticed. Many live freely in the soil or water, but there are also a large number of species that live as parasites on plants or animals and even some that feed on mold.
Insects may also have parasitic mites. Examples are "../Varroa destructor/" which attaches to the body of the honeybee, and "../Acarapis woodi/", which lives in the tracheae of honeybees. There are hundreds of species of mites associated with other bee species, and most are poorly described and understood. Some are thought to be parasites, while others beneficial symbionts.
There are over 45,000 described species of mites. Scientists believe that we have only found 5% of the total diversity of mites. Mites have existed for around 400 million years.
Most mites in the garden are pests, but some mites are predatory on other mites.
Mites are very small arthropods, with eight legs and two body segments. They have piercing-sucking mouthparts.
Mite damage includes stippling, discoloration, distorted foliage, and in the case of spider mites webbing.
The appearance of certain weeds can often be used as an indicator of certain soil types or problems regarding nutrition, pH, structure, or organic content. In many cases, weeds can be controlled by modifying the soil.
The best way to get a start on most chapters is to "transwiki" the Wikipedia article on the subject, and then modify it to suit the ../Manual of Style/ used in this book. Basing the modules of this book on Wikipedia articles has two important advantages:
The main "problem" with Wikipedia articles is simple: they're encyclopedia articles, not book chapters, and so need to be modified, rearranged, and relinked to fit into this book. In order to facilitate this, a number of templates have been developed to fit various topics, which both help suggest a framework into which the sections (or even sentences) of the Wikipedia articles can be put into, as well as helping to create a consistent structure for all chapters, which in turn makes the book a lot more useful for the home reader or classroom environment. 
The best way to start a transwiki-based module is to first Import the Wikipedia article, and then apply the relevant template and develop the chapter. The only problem with this is that only an can use the import tool. To get the article imported, simply list it on , or for faster action make the request on our main IRC channel, #wikibooks (on freenode). There are almost always administrators listening on the channel, so just type !admin for attention. 
Alternatively, contributors can simply copy-and-paste the Wikipedia article and work on it while awaiting Import. When doing this, please be sure to list both the wikipedia article and the chapter as an Import/Merge request . Note that this is a bit more difficult for administrators (several steps are involved), but it accomplishes the purpose just as well. Very active contributors who wish to import large numbers of articles should consider simple (the RFA process on wikibooks is far less stressful than it is on Wikipedia).
If there is no article on Wikipedia, or the article is a fairly useless stub, just start the chapter from scratch using the templates. 
There are a number of templates available for creating page structures in "A Wikimanual of Gardening". They must be used with "subst:" to work correctly, but the templates they include (primarily infoboxes) should not be substituted:
"Bookify" is a word occasionally used to mean "change an encyclopedia article into part of a book". The templates for "A Wikimanual of Gardening" are used to facilitate this process by providing a consistent "narrative structure". Wikipedia articles need to be "dewikified" (wikilinks either removed or replaces with subpage-style links), and for this book they need to be snipped up and re-organized to fit into the fields provided by the templates. 
The easiest way to dewikify is to simply open both the module page and the edit page side-by side, and just copy from the module and paste over the wikified version on the edit page. There are a few things to look out for however:
Bryophytes (non-vascular land plants), of which the most well-known are mosses, but also include liverworts and hortworts, are an ancient form of plants, suited to some forms of gardening. For similar uses, see lichen.
Particularly useful in rock gardens.
One of the most famous moss gardens is 苔寺 (koke dera, “moss temple”) of Saihō-ji, Kyoto.

Many weeds can be controlled effectively by simply mowing or cutting them down. This can be done with a mower, brusher, string-trimmer, or scythe.
Weeds that are susceptible to this method includes all trees and shrubs, most vines, and large herbaceous plants. Lawn weeds are of course not controllable by this method, since they are adapted to regular mowing.
Depending on the plant in question mowing can either be done regularly to continually weaken the plant, or in the case of annual weeds simply cut down before seed production to prevent their return the following year. 
Disposal of the clippings can generally be done by composting, although care should be taken if seeds are present. 
Mowing for Weed Control
Nimblewill is a perennial grass that often grows as a weed of lawns.
Mukdenia rossii is a clumping herbaceous plant native to woodlands in Eastern Asia, grown for its foliage and spring flowers.
Mulch is a protective cover placed over the soil, primarily to modify the effects of the local climate. A wide variety of natural and synthetic materials are used.
Mulch is used for various purposes:
A variety of materials are used as mulch:
The way a particular organic mulch decomposes, and reacts to wetting by rain and dew, determine in great degree its effectiveness. Organic mulches can rot rapidly rather than slowly break down, and it can mat into a barrier that blocks water and air, both conditions that can be detrimental to crops.
Living mulch may also be considered a type of mulch, or as a mulch-like cover crop. This technique involves undersowing a main crop with a fast-growing cover crop that will provide weed suppression and other benefits associated with mulch.
Mulching is an important part of any no-dig gardening regime, such as practiced within permaculture systems.
Mulch is usually applied towards the beginning of the growing season, and may be reapplied as necessary. It serves initially to warm the soil by helping it retain heat. This allows early seeding and transplanting of certain crops, and encourages faster growth. As the season progresses, the mulch stabilizes temperature and moisture, and prevents sunlight from germinating weed seed. 
Plastic mulch used in large-scale commercial production is laid down with a tractor-drawn or standalone plastic mulch layer. This is usually part of a sophisticated mechanical process, where raised beds are formed, plastic is rolled out on top, and seedlings are transplanted through it. Drip irrigation is often required, with drip tape laid under the plastic, as plastic mulch is impermeable to water.
In home gardens and smaller farming operations, organic mulch is usually spread by hand around emerged plants. For materials like straw and hay, a shredder may be used to chop up the material. Organic mulches are usually piled quite high, six inches or more, and settle over the season.
In central Pennsylvania, Harrisburg area, mulch is namely referred to as tanbark, even by manufacturers and distributors. In this area, "mulch" refers to very fine tanbark or peat moss.
Mulch should normally smell like freshly cut wood, but sometimes will develop a toxicity that will cause it to smell like vinegar, ammonia, sulfur or silage. This happens if the material is not rotated often enough and it forms pockets where no air is circulating. When this occurs, the decomposition process become anaerobic and produces these toxic materials in small quantities. Once exposed to the air, the process quickly reverts back to an aerobic decomposition, but these toxic materials will be present for a period of time. If the mulch is placed around plants before the toxicity has had a chance to dissipate, then the plants could very likely be severely damaged or killed depending on their hardiness. Plants that are predominantly low to the ground or freshly planted are the most susceptible.
If sour mulch is applied and there is plant kill, the best thing to do is just water the mulch heavily. Water will help the chemicals to dissipate more quickly and refresh the plants. By the time plant kill is noticed, most of the toxicity will have already disappeared anyway, so removing the offending mulch will have little effect. While testing after plant kill will not likely turn up anything since the toxicity will have dissipated, a simple pH check may reveal a highly acid content, perhaps in the 1.8 to 3.6 range instead of the normal 6.0 to 7.2 range. Finally, placing a bit of the offending mulch around another plant to check for plant kill will verify if the toxicity has departed. If the new plant is also killed, then sour mulch is probably not the problem.
Mulch
Mulches, when applied at the right time, can be very good for weed control and prevention. The important thing is timing: if mulches are applied at a time when weed seeds are fully dormant, they will prevent any exposure of the seed to sunlight, which is for many weed seeds the primary signal that causes them to start growing.
Mulches are most commonly applied in spring for this purpose, but many biennial and perennial weeds actually germinate in autumn, so some gardeners will mulch twice per year, or even add mulches whenever they pull weeds or otherwise disturb the soil.
Mulches are sometimes applied in combination with a pre-emergent. For organic gardeners, the pre-emergent used is corn gluten meal, which is applied under the mulch.
Mulching to Prevent Weeds
Mulching to Prevent Weeds
Mulching is a common practice in garden maintenance involving the covering of exposed soil with a loose material to provide weed control, moisture retention, and temperaturre regulation. Most often the mulch material is also organic matter which also helps raise the nutrient content of the soil, but in some cases stone or even synthetic mulches are used to provide longer-term cover. Organic mater is sometimes also raked over lawns, which is referred to as "top-dressing". In some situations, mulches are also added on top of a soil barrier, in order to smother weeds or stabilize soil.
Mulches can be applied at any time of year. They come in a variety of colors such as red , brown, and black. In most gardens, it is only applied once in the springtime as part of the spring cleanup process, but in intensive veetable gardens and many organic gardens, it is applied more than once. Whenever they are applied, it is always "after" a garden has been well-weeded and edged.
When applying mulch, it's best to start applying at the back of the garden, or in the middle in the case of "island" beds, in order to avoid walking on or rolling wheelbarrows over the mulch that's already been applied.
In gardens with large open spaces between plants, the simplest method is to simply dump the wheelbarrows or bags on the soil, then spread with a rake. In densely planted gardens, it is best to mulch by hand. 
The depth of the mulch depends on the type of mulch used: for wood mulches (the most common type in most areas due to price and availability), the mulch is generally laid 1.5" to 2" thick. 
Mulches should never be thrown on top of plant crowns, as this creates conditions conducive to rots. The mulch should be kept about 2" from any plant crown or tree trunk (it should "never" be piled up in "volcanoes" against the trunk of a tree).

Mustard greens are a leafy vegetable grown for use as a salad green or as a cooked green.
The Forget-me-nots are flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae, grown for their long-lasting blue flowers.
There are about 50 species in the genus, and among them there is considerable variation. Nevertheless a considerable number of the species fit the same description, of a small (1 cm diameter or less) rather flat 5-petalled blue flower growing profusely on straggly stems, flowering in spring. Colour variation is somewhat frequent within species, and white or pink forms are quite likely to be seen. They are popular in gardens, and cultivated forms often show a mixture of colours. The forget-me-nots need shade, not sun.
They are widely distributed. Most Myosotis species are endemic to New Zealand, though one or two European species, especially the Wood Forget-me-not, "../Myosotis sylvatica/" have been introduced in most of the temperate regions of Europe, Asia and America. "../Myosotis scorpioides/" is also known as "scorpion grass".
The name was borrowed from Old French "ne m'oubliez pas" and first used in English in c.1532. Loans and translations of it can be found in most European and some non-European languages, like German "Vergissmeinnicht", Italian "Nontiscordardimé", Polish "Niezapominajka", Slovak "Nezábudky", Danish "Forglem-mig-ej", Swedish "Förgätmigej", Dutch "vergeet-mij-nietje", Spanish "no-me-olvides", Russian "Незабудки", Bulgarian “Незабравки”, Lithuanian "Neužmirštuolės", Greek "Μη με λησμονείς" (also connected to the people who died during the 1974 events in Cyprus), Esperanto "neforgesumino", Chinese "勿忘草" (wu wang cao), Korean "물망초" (勿忘草, mul mang cho), Japanese "勿忘草" (Wasurenagusa), Hebrew "זכריני" (Zichrini), Persian "فراموشم مکن" (farâmusham nakon), Hungarian "Nefelejts", Turkish "Unutma Beni" etc. 
In the United States of America, the forget-me-not is the state flower of Alaska, precisely "../Myosotis alpestris/". The Forget-me-nots are traditionally worn by Newfoundlanders on July 1st in remembrance of those Newfoundlanders that died during the First World War. July 1 was chosen because of the high number of casualties suffered by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment on 1 July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.
Forget-me-nots can be annual or perennial plants. Their root systems are generally diffuse. Their seeds are found in small, tulip shaped pods along the stem to the flower. The pods attach to clothing when brushed against and eventually fall off, leaving the small seed within to germinate elsewhere. 
Seeds can be collected by putting a piece of paper under the stems and shaking them. The seed pods and some seeds will fall out.

The Green Peach Aphid is a pest of over 875 species of plants, including both food crops and ornamental species. 
A wide range of plants, including those in the following genera:
Neem oil is a vegetable oil pressed from the fruits and seeds of the Neem tree, "Azadirachta indica", which is endemic to the Indian sub-continent and has been introduced to many other areas in the tropics. It is perhaps the most important of the commercially available products of neem.
The oil is generally light to dark brown, bitter and has a rather strong odour that is said to combine the odours of peanut and garlic. It comprises mainly triglycerides and large amounts of triterpenoid compounds, which are responsible for the bitter taste. It is hydrophobic in nature and in order to emulisify it in water for application purposes, it must be formulated with appropriate surfactants.
Neem oil also contains steroids (campesterol, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol) and a plethora of triterpenoids of which Azadirachtin is the most well known and studied. The Azadirachtin content of Neem Oil varies from 300ppm to over 2000ppm depending on the quality of the neem seeds crushed. 
The method of processing is likely to affect the composition of the oil, since the methods used,
such as pressing (expelling) or solvent extraction are unlikely to remove exactly the same
mix of components in the same proportions.The Neem oil yield that can be obtained from neem seed kernels varies also widely in literature and varies from 25% to 45%.
The oil can be obtained through pressing (crushing) of the seed kernel both through cold pressing or through a process incorporating temperature controls. 
Neem seed oil can also be obtained by solvent extraction of the neem seed, fruit, oilcake or kernel. A large industry in India extracts the oil remaining in the seed cake using hexane. This solvent-extracted oil is of a lower quality as compared to the cold pressed oil and is mostly used for soap manufacturing.
Neem cake is a by-product obtained in the solvent extraction process for neem oil.
Neem oil is not used for cooking purposes but, in India and Bangladesh, it is used for preparing cosmetics (soap, hair products, body hygiene creams, hand creams) and in Ayurvedic, Unani and other traditional medicines is used in the treatment of a wide range of afflictions. The most frequently reported indications in ancient Ayurvedic writings are skin diseases, inflammations and fevers, and more recently rheumatic disorders, insect repellent and insecticidal effects.
Traditional Ayurvedic uses of neem include the treatment of fever, leprosy, malaria, ophthalmia and tuberculosis. Various folk remedies for neem include use as an anthelmintic, antifeedant, antiseptic, diuretic, emmenagogue, contraceptive, febrifuge, parasiticide, pediculocide and insecticide. It has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of tetanus, urticaria, eczema, scrofula and erysipelas. Traditional routes of administration of neem extracts included oral, vaginal and topical use. Neem oil has an extensive history of human use in India and surrounding regions for a variety of therapeutic purposes.
Formulations made of Neem oil also find wide usage as a bio-pesticide for organic farming, as it repels a wide variety of pests including the mealy bug, beet armyworm, aphids, the cabbage worm, nematodes and the Japanese beetle. Neem Oil is non-toxic to mammals and birds as well as many beneficial insects such as honeybees and lady bugs. Neem oil also controls black spot, powdery mildew, anthracnose and rust.
Applied in a spray at 100:1 or 200:1. Agitation is recommended.
he nematodes or roundworms (Phylum Nematoda from Greek νῆμα (nema): "thread" + -ώδη (-ode) "like") are one of the most common phyla of animals, with over 20,000 different described species (over 15,000 are parasitic). They are ubiquitous in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments, where they often outnumber other animals in both individual and species counts, and are found in locations as diverse as Antarctica and oceanic trenches. Further, there are a great many parasitic forms, including pathogens in most plants and animals, humans included. Only the Arthropoda are more diverse.
Nematodes have successfully adapted to nearly every ecological niche from marine to fresh water, from the polar regions to the tropics, as well as the highest to the lowest of elevations. Though 20,000 species have been classified it is estimated that this number may be upwards of 500,000 if all were known.. In certain fertile areas the topsoil is estimated to contain in the billions of nematodes per acre. In the 1914 edition of the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture N.A.Cobb wrote on the abundance of nematodes: "If all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes and oceans represented by a thin film of nematodes. The location of towns would be decipherable, since for every massing of human beings there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes. Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways. The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and, had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites."
Nematodes are unsegmented, thin and are round in cross section. They have no circulatory or respiratory systems so they use diffusion to breathe and for circulation of substances around their body. Nematodes are one of the simplest animal groups to have a complete digestive system, with a separate orifice for food intake and waste excretion, a pattern followed by all subsequent, more complex animals. The body cavity lacks the muscles of coelomate animals used to force food down the digestive tract. Nematodes thus depend on internal/external pressures and body movement to move food through their digestive tracts. The mouth is often surrounded by various flaps or projections used in feeding and sensation. The portion of the body past the anus is called the "tail." As they grow, their cells get larger, but the total number is constant. The epidermis secretes a layered cuticle made of three layers of collagen that protects the body from drying out, or from digestive juices or other damaging substances. Although this cuticle allows movement and shape changes, it is very inelastic so does not allow the volume of the worm to increase. Therefore, as the worm grows, it has to molt and form new cuticles. The cuticles don't allow volume to increase so as to keep hydrostatic pressure inside the organism very high. For this reason, the roundworms do not possess circular muscles (just longitudinal ones) as they're not required. This hydrostatic pressure is the reason the roundworms are round.
Most free-living nematodes are microscopic, though a few parasitic forms can grow to over a meter in length (typically as parasites of very large animals such as whales). 
Most nematodes eat bacteria, fungi and protozoans, although some are filter feeders. Excretion is through a separate excretory pore.
Nematodes have a simple nervous system, with a main nerve cord running along the ventral side. 
In free-living species, development usually consists of four molts of the cuticle during growth. Different species feed on materials as varied as algae, fungi, small animals, fecal matter, dead organisms and living tissues. One roundworm of note is "Caenorhabditis elegans", which lives in the soil and has found much use as a model organism. "C. elegans" has had its entire genome sequenced, as well as the developmental fate of every cell determined, and every neuron mapped.
Nematodes that are parasitic on animals often have quite complicated life cycles, moving between several different hosts or locations in the host's body. Infection occurs variously by eating uncooked meat with larvae in it, by entrance into unprotected cuts or directly through the skin, by transfer via blood-sucking insects, etc. 
In contrast, entomopathogenic nematodes parasitize insects and are considered by humans to be beneficial.
One form of nematode is entirely dependent upon the wasps which are the sole source of fig fertilization. They prey upon the wasps, riding them from the ripe fig of the wasp's birth to the fig flower of its death, where they kill the wasp, and their offspring await the birth of the next generation of wasps as the fig ripens. 
Plant parasitic nematodes include several groups causing severe crop losses. The most common genera are: "Aphelenchoides" (foliar nematodes), "Meloidogyne" (root-knot nematodes), "Heterodera", "Globodera" (cyst nematodes) such as the potato root nematode, "Nacobbus", "Pratylenchus" (lesion nematodes), "Ditylenchus", "Xiphinema", "Longidorus", "Trichodorus". Several phytoparasitic nematode species cause histological damages to roots, including the formation of visible galls ("Meloidogyne") which are useful characters for their diagnostic in the field. Some nematode species transmit plant viruses through their feeding activity on roots. One of them is "Xiphinema index", vector of GFLV (Grapevine Fanleaf Virus), an important disease of grapes.
Other nematodes attack bark and forest trees. The most important representative of this group is "Bursaphelenchus xylophilus", the pine wood nematode, present in Asia and America and recently discovered in Europe.
The largest known nematode is "Dioctophyma renale", the giant kidney worm, a parasite most commonly found in mink but also in dogs and humans, that can reach up to 103 cm in length.
Depending on the species, a nematode may be beneficial or detrimental to a gardener's cause.
From a gardening perspective, there are two categories of nematode: predatory ones, which will kill garden pests like cutworms or Japanese beetle grubs, and pest nematodes, like the root-knot nematode, which attack garden plants.
Predatory nematodes can be bred by soaking a specific recipe of leaves and other detritus in water, in a dark, cool place, and can even be purchased as an organic form of pest control.
The Nippon daisy ("Nipponanthemum nipponicum", synonyms include "Chrysanthemum nipponicum" and "Leucanthemum nipponicum") is a large bushy perennial which is grown for its good foliage and the large daisy-like flowers in mid- to late autumn. 
The plant grows as a mounded, shrub-like perennial up to 3 ft. tall with a wider spread. The leaves are a good dark green, and can be semi-evergreen. Flowers are heads 2-4" wide, with white rays and yellow disks. Stems are stout, green but turning light brown when old, and can root at the nodes if they are allowed to contact the soil.
Nippon daisy prefers full sun and a rich, well-drained soil. It can survive drought but may wilt temporarily if the soil becomes extremely dry. This plant becomes very large very quickly, so should be sited somewhere where there is ample space. 
While there are few cultivars of this species, it has been used as a parent plant for hybrid chrysanthemums.
Grown for fall display and as a cut flower.
The plants can be cut back by 1/2 in midsummer to encourage a more compact, bushy habit, but it will be completely covered in blooms at the end of the season even if not cut back.
Propagate by layering or division. Cuttings with buds can be rooted indoors over winter and planted outdoors in spring, but will not mature enough to bloom for several years.
As a cut flower, Nippon daisy has a long life in the vase if cut soon after they fully expand. Unopened flowers do not mature well.
This plant rarely has serious problems, but can get the same pests and diseases as Chrysanthemums.

No-till or No-dig gardening is an approach to cultivation favored by many organic gardeners. The primary reasons for digging the soil are to remove weeds, to loosen and aerate the soil and to incorporate organic matter such as compost or manure. However, there is a strong case against digging, which argues that in the long term it can be detrimental to the soil's health. While digging is an effective way of removing perennial weed roots, it can also cause dormant seeds to come to the surface and germinate. Digging can also damage soil structure, cause problems like compaction, and disturb and damage balances of the soil flora and fauna. Also, by exposure to the air, digging tends to use up nutrients which then need to be replenished.
No-dig methods rely on nature to carry out cultivation operations. Organic matter such as well rotted manure, compost, leaf mold, spent mushroom compost, old straw, etc., is added directly to the soil surface as a mulch at least 2 or 3 inches deep, which is then incorporated by the actions of earthworms and other soil animals that move it downwards. Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil's structure, their tunnels providing aeration and drainage, and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. No-dig systems are said to be freer of pests and disease, possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this comparatively undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the build up of beneficial rather than harmful soil fungi. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth.
Converting to a no-dig system is a long term process, and is reliant upon having plentiful organic matter to provide mulch material. It is also necessary to thoroughly remove any perennial weed roots from the area beforehand, although their hold can be weakened by applying a light-excluding surface layer such as large sheets of cardboard or several thicknesses of spread out newspaper (overlapped to provide thorough cover) before adding the compost mulch.
No-dig is not a technique that is appropriate in all situations, but organic gardeners and farmers should at least consider minimizing soil-disturbing practices if they are to reverse soil damage and erosion.
No-dig gardening systems are strongly recommended by Dr. Shewell Cooper of the Good Gardeners Association.

Basil ("Ocimum basilicum", family Lamiaceae) is also known as St. Joseph's Wort and Sweet Basil. It is a tender low-growing herb, originally native to tropical Asia. It grows to between 20–60 cm tall, with opposite, light green, silky leaves 1.5–5 cm long and 1–3 cm broad. It tastes somewhat like anise, with a strong, pungent, sweet smell. Basil is very sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. While most common varieties are treated as annuals, some are perennial, including African Blue and Holy Thai basil.
The word "basil" comes from the Greek βασιλευς, meaning "king", as it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross. The "Oxford English Dictionary" quotes speculations that basil may have been used in "some royal unguent, bath, or medicine". Basil is still considered the "king of herbs" by many cookery authors. An alternative etymology has "basil" coming from the Latin word "basilicus", meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk, but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece.
Basil is most commonly recommended to be used fresh, and in cooked recipes, is generally added at the last moment, as cooking destroys the flavour quickly. The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. Place fresh leaves in a dry jar with a pinch of salt, and cover with olive oil. The dried herb also loses most of its flavour, and what little flavour remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavour, like hay. But because most Americans either lack the dedication or resources to maintain a supply of fresh herbs, the most common household use of basil in the US is through containers of dried basil purchased from stores.
Mediterranean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines frequently use basil, the former frequently combining it with tomato. Basil is one of the main ingredients in pesto — a green Italian oil-and-herb sauce from the city of Genoa, its other two main ingredients being olive oil and pine nuts. The most commonly used Mediterranean basil cultivars are 'Genovese', 'Purple Ruffles', 'Mammoth', 'Cinnamon', 'Lemon', 'Globe', and 'African Blue'. Chinese cuisine also uses fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods. In Taiwan, people add fresh basil leaves into thick soups (羹湯; gēngtāng). They also eat fried chicken with deep-fried basil leaves.
Basil is sometimes used with fresh fruit and in fruit jams and sauces — in particular with strawberries, but also raspberries or dark-colored plums. Arguably the flat-leaf basil used in Vietnamese cooking, which has a slightly different flavour, is more suitable for use with fruit.
When soaked in water the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous, and are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as falooda or sherbet. Such seeds are known variously as "sabja", "subja", "takmaria", "tukmaria", or "falooda" seeds. They are used for their medicinal properties in Ayurveda, the traditional medicinal system of India.
Several other basils, including some other "Ocimum" species, are grown in many regions of Asia. Most of the Asian basils have a clove-like flavour that is generally stronger than the Mediterranean basils. In China, the local cultivar is called 九層塔 ("jiǔcéngtǎ"; literally "nine-level pagoda"), while the imported varieties are specifically called 羅勒 ("luólè") or 巴西里 ("bāxīlǐ").
Basil is also very popular in Thai cuisine, which uses cultivars of two different species: the type known in the west as Thai Basil, which is a cultivar of "O. basilicum", and Holy Basil ("Ocimum sanctum").
'Lemon basil' has a strong lemony smell and flavour very different from those of other varieties, because it contains a chemical called citral. It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called "kemangi" and served raw, together with raw cabbage, green beans, and cucumber, as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, broken up, are a zesty salad condiment.
Basil thrives in hot weather, but behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. In Northern Europe, the northern states of the U.S., and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a peat pot, then planted out in late spring/early summer (when there is little chance of a frost). It fares best in a well-drained sunny spot.
Although basil will grow best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a south-facing windowsill (in the Northern Hemisphere). It should be kept away from any draughts, and must be able to get plenty of sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or cloche is ideal if available.
If its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location. Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant needs more sunlight or less fertilizer.
In sunnier climates such as Southern Europe, the southern states of the U.S., the North Island of New Zealand, and Australia, basil will thrive when planted outside. It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States, but dies out when temperatures reach the low thirties, to grow again the next year if it was allowed to go to seed. It will need regular watering, but not as much attention as is needed in other climates.
Basil can also be propagated very reliably from cuttings in exactly the same manner as "Busy Lizzie" (Impatiens), with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop.
Leaf production slows or stops on any stem which flowers, so you can pinch off any flower stems to keep the plant in production, or pinch off some stems while leaving others to bloom for decoration or seeds. Once you do let the plant flower, it will produce seed pods containing small black seeds which you can save and plant the following year. Picking the leaves off the plant helps "promote growth", largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems.
Onopordum acanthium (Cotton thistle, Scotch thistle, Scottish thistle, Spear thistle) is a flowering plant in the Family ../Asteraceae/. Other common names include, Scotch thistle, and Scotch cotton thistle. Native to Europe, North Africa and Asia, it is a vigorous, biennial with coarse, spiny leaves and conspicuous spiny-winged stems.
The botanical name is derived from the Greek words onos (donkey), perdo (to consume), and acanthos (thorn), meaning 'thorny plant eaten by donkeys'. The common name Cotton thistle derives from the cotton-like hairs on the leaves; the name Scotch thistle comes from a legend that the plant's thorny thickets helped protect Scotland from the Vikings. Oral folklore holds that as Vikings attempted to sneak up at night to attack and raid Scottish villages, they were stuck by the thistles' thorns and cried out in pain, alerting the townsfolk to the attack and allowing them to fight back and drive back the invaders. Following this the Thistle was adopted as the floral emblem of Scotland.
Cotton thistle is a biennial plant, producing a large rosette of spiny leaves the first year. The plants typically germinate in the autumn after the first rains and exist as rosettes throughout the first year, forming a stout, fleshy taproot that may extend down 30 cm or more for a food reserve.
In the second year, the plant grows (0.2-) 0.5–3 m tall and a width of 1.5 m. The leaves are 10–50 cm wide, are alternate and spiny, often covered with white woolly hairs, with the lower surface more densely covered than the upper. The leaves are deeply lobed with long, stiff spines along the margins. The leaves have winged appearance that continues down the stems of the plant. Fine hairs give the plant a greyish appearance (Global). The massive, main stem may be 10 cm wide at the base, and is branched in the upper part. Each stem shows a vertical rows of broad, spiny wings (conspicuous ribbon-like leafy material), typically 2-3 cm wide, extending to the base of the flower head.
The flowers are globe-shaped, 3-5 cm in diameter, from dark pink to lavender, and are produced in the summer from July to September. The flower buds form first at the tip of the stem and later at the tip of the axillary branches. The flower heads exist singly or in groups of 2 or 3 on branch tips. They are androgynous, with both pistil and stamens, and sit above numerous, long, stiff, spine-tipped bracts, all pointing outwards, the lower ones wider apart and pointing downwards. After flowering, the ovary starts swelling and forms about 8,400 to 40,000 seeds per plant.
It prefers habitats with dry summers, such as the Mediterranean, growing in sandy, sandy clay and calcareous soils, rich in ammonium salts. It grows in ruderal places, as well as dry pastures and disturbed fields. Its preferred habitats are natural areas, disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, and especially sites with fertile soils (Encycloweedia), agricultural areas, range/grasslands, riparian zones, scrub/shrublands, water courses.
Cotton thistle reproduces only by seeds. Most seeds germinate in fall after the first rains, but some seeds can germinate year round under favorable moisture and temperature conditions. Seeds that germinate in late fall become biennials. But when they germinate earlier, they can behave as annuals. Buried seed can remain viable in the soil seed bank for at least 7 years and possibly 20 years or more. Yearly seed production and seed dormancy are highly variable depending on environmental conditions. These slender and smooth achenes are about 3 mm long and are brown with gray markings. They are tipped with a pappus of slender bristles. They are mainly locally dispersed by wind, or more widely by humans, birds, wildlife, livestock or streams. The seeds are sensitive to light and only germinate when close to the surface. Seedlings will emerge from soil depths up to 4.5 cm, with 0.5 cm being optimal.
In the late 19th century, it was introduced to North America and temperate Australia as an ornamental plant, and is now considered a major agricultural and wildland noxious weed problem in areas it has been introduced. It is difficult to eradicate because of its drought resistance. It can spread rapidly and in the end dense stands prohibit foraging by livestock. Infestations of Cotton thistle often start in disturbed areas such as roadways, campsites, burned areas, and ditch banks. The weed adapts best to areas along rivers and streams, but can be a serious problem in pastures, grain fields, and range areas. A single Cotton thistle is imposing enough, but an entire colony can ruin a pasture or destroy a park or campsite, sometimes forming tall, dense, impenetrable stands. Besides creating an impenetrable barrier to humans and animals, Cotton thistle nearly eliminates forage use by livestock and some mammal species such as deer and elk.
Known infestations include most of the Pacific Northwest along with Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota. On western rangeland, infestations directly result in significant economic losses for ranchers.
Cotton thistle is sold as an ornamental plant. It has reportedly been used to treat cancers and ulcers and to diminish discharges of mucous membranes. The receptacle was eaten in earlier times like an artichoke. The cottony hairs on the stem have been occasionally collected to stuff pillows. Oil from Cotton thistle seeds has been used in Europe for burning and cooking. Cotton thistle is the national emblem of Scotland, dating from the time of James III of Scotland. The thistle is also part of the logo of Encyclopædia Britannica.
Organic Gardening (also called Organic Horticulture) is a growing practice among gardeners around the world, as an alternative to gardening through the use of synthetic chemicals. This wikibook contains techniques and tips for gardeners wishing to use organic methods.
While the movement behind organic gardening began as a "back to basics" movement, over the past several decades the practice has become enriched by scientific research in the fields of ecology, ethnobotany, microbiology, and agronomy.
The practice of organic gardening can be described as "gardening with a limited toolbox", since organic gardeners do not use synthetic fertilizers or other synthetic chemicals. Non-synthetic fertilisers and chemicals can be used, however, depending on the gardeners preference.
Horticulture does not (at least presently) have separate pages for organic gardeners, but rather points out the "organic remedies" when a particular issue is discussed. 
Organic Gardening
Organic lawn care is a method of establishing and caring for a garden lawn without the use of synthetic chemical inputs such as pesticides, herbicides, or artificial fertilisers. Using organic practices on a lawn is a good way to avoid exposure to potentially harmful chemicals, since among all the elements of the garden, the lawn is the part that humans come in contact with the most often, either through walking or sitting on the lawn, as well as through exposure to pets that have been on the lawn.
Managed organically, the lawn can be more than simply a green carpet and can contribute to the overall biodiversity and richness of the garden ecosystem. Organic lawns can be valuable habitats in their own right, providing a home for a variety of insects, birds and other wildlife. Indeed, by relaxing a little and allowing the grass to grow longer, we will find that the lawn becomes healthier, requires less work and even becomes more visually interesting.
An important principle of organic lawn care is the choosing of grasses that will suit the location and the type of lawn required, and the uses that will be expected of it. Hard wearing grass mixes can be chosen for lawns used for football and play, whilst shady spots or a fine quality ‘ornamental’ lawn would have different requirements. 
Cool season grasses are grown in climates with cold winters. They are evergreen, but may go dormant in midsummer.
Warm season grasses do well in hot climates. They are green throughout the heat of summer, but will go dormant during cold weather.
The frequency and height of cut will depend on the use to which the lawn will be put. By varying them the lawn can have either a formal appearance or a more natural look. There are a wide variety of lawnmowers available, and again, these should be chosen to be appropriate to needs and circumstances. For a small lawn a hand push mower with cylinder cutting blades would be sufficient, but for larger areas it might be worthwhile to consider the benefits of power mowers, including mulching mowers. These chop the cut grass into tiny fragments which are then blown down close to the soil surface where they will quickly decompose, recycling nutrients and adding fertility to the turf. Regular mowing should only be required during the growing season between spring and autumn. Frequency will depend upon speed of growth, which will vary according to conditions, but generally speaking a weekly trim will be sufficient in early spring, increasing to twice a week later on, especially on play areas or that are required to be neater. Grass growth decreases again in autumn, and whilst the grass will still grow in winter, it isn’t usually necessary to mow, besides which conditions are often too wet.
Longer grass tends to resist drought better than short grass, and is more able to compete with weed growth. Most lawn areas can be cut to about 3 cm (1.5”), although may be shorter in play areas. Lawn mowings should never be discarded, instead should be either composted, used as a high nitrogen compost activator or used as a mulch around trees, shrubs or vegetables.
The organic gardener can recreate the traditional ‘stripe’ pattern favoured in more formal landscapes simply by using a cylinder mower or one fitted with a rear roller, but these can be a chore to maintain. Instead interest and wildlife friendly habitats can be created by mowing large lawn areas to different heights, leaving some areas to grow long with mown ‘paths’ between them.
Lawn edges can be trimmed with long handled shears, which avoid the need to bend down, and occasionally cut to a clean border edge using a spade or half-moon edge cutter.
Lawns do not have to consist of only grasses, indeed they will be colonised by a variety of other plant species. A tolerant attitude will see this as an asset rather than a problem to be eradicated. For example, allowing clover ("Trifolium" spp.) to spread will feed the grass with nitrogen. The grass will therefore grow more strongly and will be a deeper green, and will not require artificial nitrogen fertilisers. Yarrow ("Achillea millefolium") will also grow very well in the lawn, and is a valuable plant in its own right, being rich in minerals and greatly enriching the compost heap. It will also increase the vigour of grass and its resistance to disease. Yarrow also has medicinal properties, and if left uncut will produce beautiful white flowers. Daisies ("Bellis perennis") will also brighten any lawn, often flowering even into the depths of winter, whilst another attractive lawn flower, the dandelion ("Taraxacum officinale") has a wealth of uses, all parts are edible and it has medicinal properties. In addition its deep tap root will mine minerals from deep in the subsoil to be made available via the compost heap. Other valuable wild plants that will often make themselves at home in the organic lawn include chicory ("Cichorium intybus"), catsear ("Hypochoeris radicata"), melilot ("Melilotus officinalis"), salad burnet ("Sanguisorba minor"), plantain ("Plantago spp."), rough hawkbit ("Leontodon hispidus") and coltsfoot ("Tussilago farfara").
If however weeds do become a problem, there are organic methods which can be used to control them, including;
Moss can be a problem on some lawns, thriving in moist or waterlogged conditions, but also on drier soils where fertility is poor and acidity high (in particular, under evergreen trees). Moss will colonise in shady areas and spread over soil where the grass is mown too short. Moss does not withstand foot traffic as well as grasses, and trampled moss can result in bare soil and soil loss. Moss can be controlled by regular raking in spring and autumn. Bare patches should be re-seeded, and a poor lawn should be fed, for example with seaweed meal. In addition, mower blades should be raised to 2.5 cm (1”), drainage should be improved (see below) and limestone or dolomitic lime added to raise the Soil pH levels. Moss is valuable to birds as nesting material, so the wildlife conscious organic gardener may opt to leave some areas of mossy lawn for this reason.
Lawn pests can include;
The lawn is made up of millions of individual plants, and as with other parts of the garden, a healthy and fertile soil with a good soil structure is essential to obtaining good results. Feeding the lawn should not be necessary unless growth is poor, in which case an organic fertilizer such as seaweed meal can be raked in as a top dressing, or else garden compost can be thinly spread over the lawn surface.
An annual top dressing consisting of a mix of 3 parts sharp sand, 1 part loam and 1 part bulky organic material on heavy soils where moss is a problem can be beneficial, as can 2 parts loam to 3 parts bulky organic material on lighter, free-draining sandy lawns. Over-fertilizing a lawn, however, can actually reduce biodiversity. Many plants, in particular legumes such as Clover, thrive in nitrogen-poor lawns, and adding nitrogen can eliminate these plants.
Acid soil conditions can cause a build up of fibrous organic matter and debris called thatch, and can also encourage weeds such as sheep’s sorrel. If the pH is below 5.5-6, lime the area to raise it to around 7. Ground limestone ordolomiticc lime evenly sprinkled over the lawn and gently raked in is the appropriate organic treatment. Repeat annually if required until the desired pH is reached. Vigorously raking the lawn in autumn with a lawn rake to remove debris and leaves is known as scarifying. In addition to preventing diseases and removing obstructions to the growing grass, this process will help the lawn to thicken up by encouraging side shoot production.
Aerating the lawn is the process of creating holes in the soil in order to improve drainage and increase air circulation, and can be particularly beneficial on compacted areas. This is best carried out in early autumn when the soil is moist. A special hollow tined aerator can be used, which takes out a core of soil about 10 cm (4”) deep, or else the soil can simply be spiked with a fork on small areas. Most lawns should not need to be aerated more than once every three years or so.
Lawns are usually established with grasses, but other evergreen species can be used. These include chamomile ("Chamaemelum nobilee"), which releases a sweet, apple like scent when crushed underfoot, and is thus very useful in a sensory landscape, or as a feature in the herb garden. However such a lawn will not tolerate heavy wear. The non flowering clone Treneaguee’ is especially suitable for the establishment of a chamomile lawn as it is naturally low growing. Cotulaa’ has fern like leaves and is more hard-wearing, but will not survive temperatures below −4 °C (25 °F). Another alternative, particularly where space is abundant, might be to establish a wild flower meadow. Simply leave some areas uncut and see what comes up, or else a wild flower meadow can be created by using one of the numerous seed mixes that are available that include a selection of wild flowers and grasses. Wild flowers prefer poorer soils, so should not be fertilized. Mowing is carried out infrequently, preferably on a sunny day after a period of dry weather. Mowings should be left on the ground to dry out, then shaken well in order to release any seed, but should not be left to break down as this will tend to raise fertility levels.
In shady yards, a grassy lawn can be particularly difficult to maintain. Grasses are best adapted to full sunlight, and in shade tend to be out-competed by a variety of plants, including mosses, Ground ivy, and other plants. These plants can combine to form a robust ground-cover that can withstand periodic mowing and some foot traffic. Mowing in such shade lawns needs to be carried out less often, since the plants grow more slowly due to the lack of sunlight. Care should be taken to not mow the lawn too close to the ground, as shady yards tend to have less dense growth, and removal of too many plants can lead to soil loss. In the most shaded yards, many people choose to forgo mowed lawns entirely and choose instead to use a ground cover that does not require mowing.
Organic Lawn Care
Organic pesticides are pesticides that are acceptable in organic growing practices. As a rule, they are derived from botanical sources, unprocessed minerals, or are biological agents. 
Organic weed management is a particular approach to garden weed control that does not make use of synthetic chemicals. All of the weed profiles in Horticulture include both organic and non-organic methods for controlling particular weeds, since the only excluded methods are those that use the various synthetic herbicides: otherwise the methods are identical.
Organic weed control is most difficult when there are well-established perennial weeds, particularly in densely planted gardens. While methods such as paper mulch barriers often work well in these situations, they may not be appropriate in mixed borders with shallow-rooted shrubs. In these cases, vigilance in pulling or cultivating is the only available approach.
Organic Weed Management
The black vine weevil, "Otiorhynchus sulcatus", is native to Europe, but common in North America as well. This weevil is a pest of many garden plants, causing the most damage on evergreen trees and shrubs. 
The adult weevil is black with fused wing covers, and is unable to fly. Adults feed at night on the outer edges of leaves, causing the leaves to have a notched margin. 
Grubs live below the soil surface, and feed on the roots and on the cambium at the base of the trunk. 
Host plants include but are not limited to the following genera:

Grasses
Creeping wood sorrel ("Oxalis corniculata"), also known as yellow wood sorrel and procumbent yellow sorrel, is a somewhat delicate-appearing, low-growing, herbaceous plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is commonly found as a weed of lawns, gardens, and pathways.
This woodsorrel is a low-growing, herbaceaous plant with a narrow, creeping stem that readily roots at the nodes. The trifoliate leaves are subdivided into three rounded leaflets and resemble a shamrock. Some varieties have green leaves, while others have purple leaves, like the "Oxalis corniculata" var. "atropurpurea" shown in the photo. The leaves have inconspicuous stipules at the base of each petiole.
The fruit is a narrow, cylindrical capsule, 1 to 2 cm long and noteworthy for its explosive discharge of the contained, 1 mm long seeds.
This species is cosmopolitan in its distribution, and its place of origin is unknown. It is regarded as weed in gardens, agricultural fields, and lawns.
The leaves of wood sorrel are edible, having a tangy taste. A drink can be made by infusing the leaves in hot water for about 10 minutes, sweetening and then chilling. The entire plant is rich in Vitamin C. Although wood sorrel is safe in low dosages, it can inhibit calcium absorption by the body if eaten in large quantities over a length of time.
Control of this plant can be difficult because it can grow back from small stem and root fragments.
Yellow Woodsorrel ("Oxalis stricta") is an annual woodland and meadow plant native to North America, where it is among the most common garden weeds. 
From late spring through autumn, it produces yellow flowers which are quickly followed by explosively opening seed capsules. 
The flowers, seed pods and leaves are edible with a taste similar to lemons, green grapes and sunshine all rolled into one. 
Packera obovata is a wildflower native to eastern North America, where it grows in low meadows and fields. It is sometimes included in native wildflower mixes.
Paeonia obovata is one of the herbaceous peonies, native to Japan and eastern Asia. It is grown in part for the spring flowers, but even more so for the attractive fruits.
The Pansy or Pansy Violet is a low-growing plant cultivated for its showy flowers. It is derived from the wildflower called the Heartsease or Johnny Jump Up ("Viola tricolor"), and is sometimes given the subspecies name "Viola tricolor hortensis". However, many garden varieties are hybrids and are referred to as "Viola × wittrockiana". The name "pansy" also appears as part of the common name of a number of wild flowers belonging, like the cultivated Pansy, to the violet genus "../Viola/". One or two unrelated flowers such as the Pansy Monkeyflower also have "pansy" in their name. 
The pansy gets its name from the French word "pensee" meaning "thought". It was so named because the flower resembles a human face and in August it nods forward as if deep in thought. Because of the origin of its name, the Pansy has long been a symbol of Freethought and has been used in the literature of the American Secular Union. Humanists like the symbol also, as the pansy's current appearance was developed from the Heartsease by two centuries of intentional cross-breeding of wild plant hybrids. The Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) uses the pansy symbol extensively in its lapel pins and literature.
The pansy has two top petals overlapping slightly, two side petals, beards where the three lower petals join the center of the flower, a single bottom petal with a slight indentation. The flowers are referred to as "faces".
Pansies have extensively bred for colors ranging from gold and orange though to purple, violet, and a blue so deep as to be almost black. They are quite a hardy plant, growing well in sunny or partially sunny positions. Pansies are technically biennials that normally have two-year life cycles. The first year they only produce greenery; they bear flowers and seeds in their second year of growth, and afterwards die like annuals. 
Most gardeners buy biennials as packs of young plants from the garden center and plant them directly into the garden soil. Gardeners interested in rarer cultivars can plant seeds indoors in early November for plants ready in the spring. Under good conditions, pansies and viola are perennial plants, although they are generally treated as annual or biennial plants because they get very leggy and overgrown after a few years. The mature plant grows to 9 inches (23 cm) high, and the flowers are two to three inches (about 6 cm) in diameter. 
Pansies are hardy in USDA plant hardiness zone 4-8. They can survive light freezes or a little snow, but not for very long. In warmer climates, USDA plant hardiness zones 9-11, pansies can bloom over the winter, and are often planted in the fall. In these climates, pansies have been known to reseed themselves and come back the next year. Pansies are not very heat-tolerant - once the temperature gets over a certain point they will become leggy and stop blooming.
Pansies should be watered thoroughly about once a week, depending on climate and recent rainfall. For maximum bloom, plant food about every other week, according to the plant food directions. Regular deadheading can extend the blooming period.
Diseases
The plant may collapse without warning in the middle of season. The foliage will flag and lose color. Flowers will fade and shrivel prematurely. Stem will snap at the soil line if tugged slightly.
The plant is probably a total loss unless tufted.
Soil-borne fungus. Possible hazard with unsterilized animal manure.
Use Cheshunt or modern Benomyl fungicide prior to planting. Destroy (burn) infected plants.
2 parts finely ground copper sulphate
11 parts fresh ammonium carbonate
Mix thoroughly and stand for 2 hours in sealed container. Dissolve 1 ounce (28 g) in a little hot water and add this to 2 gallons of cold water and use immediately.
"Puccinia aegra" fungal infection. Yellow-brown spots on leaves and stem. Spray with Benomyl or Sulphide of Potassium (1 ounce to 2 1/2 gallons)
"Ramularia deflectens" fungal infection. Dark spots on leaf margins followed by a white web covering the leaves. Associated with cool damp springs. Spray with fungicide.
"Oidium" fungal infection. Violet-gray powder on fringes and underside of leaves. Caused by stagnant air. Can be limited but not necessarily eliminated by spraying (especially leaf undersides).
Transmitted by aphids. Fine yellow veining on young leaves, stunted growth, anomalous flowers. Virus can lay dormant, affect the entire plant and be passed to next generations and to other species. Prevention is key: purchase healthy plants, use ph-balanced soil which is neither too damp not too dry. Soil should have balanced amounts of nitrogen, phosphate, potash. Eliminate other diseases which may weaken the plant.
Lay sharp, gritty sand or top-dress soil with chipped bark. Clean area of leaves and foreign matter, etc.
Spray with diluted soft soap (2 ounce per gallon)
Aphids are microscopic and lay eggs.
The Common Stalk Borer, "Papaipema nebris", is a pest of a very wide range of host plants. 
Caterpillars are brown with a white dorsal stripe, primarily living inside the stalks or twigs of host plants, but migrating between hosts as they grow. Adults are gray moths.
Tunnelling of stalks and twigs.
Overwintering as pupae in weedy areas. More problematic in no-till systems, since plowing under provides good control.
One of the most effective ways to control perennial weeds in the organic garden is to use the Newspaper-and-Mulch Method. The action is quite simple: the newspaper acts as a physical barrier which prevents perennial weeds from growing above-ground, which over time starves the plant, since it is unable to photosynthesize. The results are very good if it’s done properly.
This method should not be used around some shallow-rooted shrubs (particularly some plants in ../Ericaceae/). Digging dogs and squirrels can undo the barriers as well, so the treated areas need to be monitored carefully if these animals are present in the garden. 
Once all the materials are together, it’s time to prepare the area for application. If it is a new bed (without ornamental plants already growing), start by mowing or weed-wacking as close to the ground as possible. Tilling is also an option, as long as you can get the soil good and smooth afterwards, and compact it a bit with a rake. Make sure that the outermost 6 inches or so of the bed are as weed-free as possible, so plants can't just grow around the barrier.
If there are already ornamental plants growing, more care is needed. Shrubs and small trees with shallow root systems will not appreciate having paper on their roots, so you’ll need to carefully hand-weed within their driplines. Outside the dripline, cultivate just as you would on a new bed. Perennials are usually OK with the newspaper laid within 4” of their crowns. 
If the bed is badly invaded with running weeds like bindweed, thistle, goutweed, it’s usually better to just cut everything down to the ground, transplant and quarantine the shrubs, and apply newspaper to the entire area.
Prepare the newspaper by thoroughly soaking it in water to give it weight and help it bind together. The easiest system for doing this is to have two tubs of water, so one tub can be used for soaking while you pull paper out of the other one. 
Once the paper is thoroughly wet, begin laying it down on top of the soil. Use whole sections, not unfolded, and let them overlap by 1/2, so that the entire soil surface has 2 sections on it, at least 1/4 inch thick (1/2 inch is even better). Once the paper is down, pat the sections together so they’ll start to form a continuous layer. This layer will keep perennial weeds or turf from poking through, effectively smothering the weeds and denying them light. Leave at least 2 inches on the outer portion of the bed to allow for edging without having to cut through the paper.
Once the paper is down, and before it starts to dry, start laying down mulch on top. Don’t dump wheelbarrows on the paper, but instead place it by hand, to avoid disturbing the newspaper as much as possible (unlike mulching without a barrier, it's actually better to go from front to back, rather than back to front). Put on enough mulch to thoroughly cover the paper, as this will not only look nicer, but will also prevent the wind from blowing the paper around the yard. 
If it’s a “must plant” location, use 6 inches of compost instead of mulch, and grow annuals and shallow rooting vegetables on top (keep in mind that you’ll need to water the bed more often than the surrounding soil, because soil moisture will not wick up through the paper barrier as much as it would if the paper wasn’t there). With that much compost sitting atop the bed, it’s a good idea to use some logs on the edge (on top of the paper) to keep it from washing into adjacent areas.
As a rule, you’ll want to leave the bed alone for about a year to ensure that the perennial weeds are completely smothered. Use the area in the meantime for containers, ornaments, to store new plant acquisitions in, or as the quarantine site for any shrubs you might have moved. 
Make a regular inspection for tenacious weeds that might try to pop through the paper, and if you see any, brush the mulch aside, find the hole they’re using, and add a patch layer of newspapers to seal it up.
Once you’ve had a full year without any weeds poking through, it’s safe to till the bed and start growing in it. Keep in mind that there will still be weed seeds in the soil, but the pernicious perennials will be history, as long as you keep on top of the new seedlings. If using a tiller, remove any large pieces of paper and add them to the compost pile, as they are a carbon source and may divert nitrogen from the soil.
Paper Mulch Barriers
Paulownia tomentosa (also known as the Empress Tree, Princess Tree or Foxglove Tree; pao tong 泡桐 in Chinese) is a deciduous flowering tree native to central and western China, but invasive in the US . 
It grows to 10-25 m tall, with large heart-shaped to five-lobed leaves 15-40 cm across, arranged in opposite pairs on the stem. On young growth, the leaves may be in whorls of three and be much bigger than the leaves on more mature growth (image comparing large and small trees). The characteristic large size of the young growth is exploited by gardeners : by pollarding the tree and ensuring there is vigorous new growth every year, massive leaves are produced (up to 60cm across). These are popular in the modern style of gardening which uses large-foliaged and "architectural" plants. The flowers are produced before the leaves in early spring, on panicles 10-30 cm long, with a tubular purple corolla 4-6 cm long resembling a foxglove flower. The fruit is a dry egg-shaped capsule 3-4 cm long, containing numerous tiny seeds. The seeds are winged and disperse by wind and water. Pollarded trees do not produce flowers, as these only form on mature wood.
Paulownia tomentosa can survive wildfire because the roots can regenerate new, very fast-growing stems. It is tolerant of pollution and it is not fussy about soil type. For this reason it functions ecologically as a pioneer plant. Its nitrogen-rich leaves provide good fodder and its roots prevent soil erosion. Eventually, "Paulownia" is succeeded by taller trees that shade it. It cannot thrive in the shade of other trees.
The soft, lightweight seeds were commonly used as a packing material by Chinese porcelain exporters in the 19th century, before the development of polystyrene packaging. Packing cases would often leak or burst open in transit and scatter the seeds along rail tracks. This, together with seeds released by specimens deliberately planted for ornament, has allowed the species to become an invasive weed tree in areas where the climate is suitable for its growth, notably Japan and the eastern United States. 
In China, an old custom is to plant an Empress Tree when a baby girl is born. The fast-growing tree matures when she does. When she is eligible for marriage the tree is cut down and carved into wooden articles for her dowry, and carving the wood of Paulownia is an art form in Japan and China. 
In the late 20th Century, permaculture started to become used as a design tool by gardeners and farmers as a way to ecologically design gardens.
Permaculture had 3 main guiding design ideas:
Permaculture
Smartweeds are a group of plants in the genus "Persicaria", which are usually encountered either as wildflowers or as weeds of lawns and gardens. The majority are annuals. 
Plants in this genus have swollen nodes and alternate, simple, spearhead-shaped leaves. The small flowers are held above the foliage on spikes, and are either pink or white. Flowers are borne from late spring through mid autumn, the seeds are likewise white or pink. Plants can be prostrate or bushy, depending on growing conditions and species.
Smartweeds can be aggressive weeds of lawns and gardens, walkways, and patios, growing in both rich and poor soils.
Like buckwheat (which is closely related), the smartweeds can be used as a cover crop or green manure source, though self-seeding can become a nuisance if the plants are not mowed down before the seeds mature. 
Some species and varieties are also grown as ornamental plants.
Pest Barriers are used in the garden to keep pest animals away from plants. Barriers include everything from electric fences (for large animals) to row covers (for flying insects) to kaolin sprays.
This is a template of sorts...
Barriers prevent the pest from reaching the plant.
Repellents are chemicals (or plants containing those chemicals) that make the pest avoid the plant.
Physical removal means removing the pests by hand, crushing them, blasting them with water, vacuuming them up, etc.
Trap crops are plants that the pest prefers over the plants you are trying to protect.
Poisons are chemicals that kill the pest. Most poisons are specific.
Pest Control Methods
Pest Profiles
Pest repellents keep pests away from plants (or in some cases people or pets), without necessarily being lethal to the pest.
Many garden pests can be controlled or monitored for using traps. Traps attract the pest using food scents, pheromones, colors, or a combination of these to attract pests.
Pesticides are substances that are poisonous to garden pests.

Phlox paniculata is an herbaceous perennial widely grown for its showy panicles of large, sweet-scented flowers borne from early summer through autumn.
The plants are clump-forming and erect, with terminal panicles of trumpet-shaped flowers. Flower colors vary from white through pink, red, purple, and nearly blue.
Performs best in full sun with humus-rich, well-drained soils.
Numerous varieties are available in the trade. Modern cultivars have been selected for resistance to powdery mildews.
Grown for the showy flowers, which are also attractive to both hummingbirds and butterflies. Flowers hold up well in the vase as well.
Deadheading encourages rebloom. 
Self-sows readily. Cultivars are generally reproduced by cuttings or tissue culture. 
Powdery mildew is a serious issue for this species. See "..Phlox/" for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus.
Phlox stolonifera (Creeping phlox, Moss phlox, Flowering moss, Ground pink, or Moss pinks) is a flowering native to the eastern United States in the forests of the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south to northern Georgia.
It is a creeping stoloniferous perennial plant growing 15-25 cm tall. The leaves on creeping stems are 3-4.5 cm long and 1.8 cm broad, those on the erect flowering stems smaller, 2 cm long. The flowers are produced in early spring, 2-2.5 cm diameter, with the five-lobed corolla pale violet to purple, pink or white in color, and yellow stamens.
Phlox subulata (Moss Phlox, Moss Pink, Mountain Phlox) is a perennial creeper growing to a height of 6 inches and covering a 20 inch wide area. The small, five-petaled flowers bloom in rose, mauve, blue, white, or pink in late spring to early summer.
Many garden pests can be controlled by simply removing them from the plant. In some cases, they can be simply "squished", in others they can be pruned out or blasted off with high-pressure water. 
One way of getting plant diseases under control is to simply remove the infected parts, in the hopes of preventing the spread of the infection to other parts of the plant. 
Care must be taken to make sure pruning equipment is kept sterile, to avoid becoming a "vector" for the disease.
Disposal of these wastes depends on the particular pathogen involved.
Physical Removal of Plant Pathogens
Physocarpus (Ninebark) is a genus of about ten species of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to North America (most of the species) and northeastern Asia (one species).
They are deciduous shrubs growing to 1-3 m tall. The name comes from the appearance of the bark, which is flaky, peeling away in many layers. The leaves are maple-like, palmately lobed, 3-15 cm long and broad, with an irregularly serrated margin. The flowers are white with five petals and numerous stamens, produced in corymbs. The fruit is a cluster of inflated follicles, which turn dry and brown and then split open to release the seeds.
Current use of this plant in its name cultivars (see below) for landscape design is to form a line of uninterrupted, loose informal hedge. Individual specimens may be used for the attractive colors of the foliage. There are little medicinal or food uses of this plant.
Much development has gone into developing attractive foliage and smaller size of this native shrub. Two popular and common cultivars exist. 'Darts Gold' is a gold color leaf version of this native plant, while 'Diablo', a purple (almost black) leaf cultivar also exists.
Since the new century, much work is continuing to develop hybrids based on the above two cultivars. 'Coppertina' a cultivar exhibiting orange-red leaves, is such a development, created when the above two cultivars were crossed.
Little maintenance is required for this native shrub once established. To maintain the shape of the plant, pruning is highly recommended. As the old branches exhibit an exfoliating bark which is for some gardeners its chief attraction, leaving the older branches on the plant is often achieved by only pruning and rejuvenating one third of the older branches on a plant in any one year. If a more youthful looking plant is desired, then hard pruning of all the older branches may also be accomplished. In such a case, pruning should be conducted during the spring.
Like all native shrubs that originate from a basal rosette of stems from a common root, this native North American shrub is easy to propagate.
The shrub after flowering forms many tiny seeds, which are held onto the plant well into winter. Mature seeds may be easily released when the shrub is brushed against or shaken. Seedlings formed from self seeding into cracks and crevices may be carefully removed and transplanted.
Another method of propagation is to divide the basal clump of stems, ensuring each group of stems are attached to a viable root. This is done by cleaving the clump at the basal rosette of stems, right down to the root level, separating the one clump into two or more smaller clumps. Each small clump can then be transplanted. In this initial stage, adequate watering is crucial to ensure the survival of the severed clumps. If a severed clump survives the first winter, it will live on. Severing of the clumps may be done anytime, but typically fall time is best, as the cooler temperatures and increased rainfall ensure less evaporation and demands on the smaller severed root system.
A third method is achieved by layering a long branch. This is done by bending one of the younger more flexible stems to the ground, and pinning it in place. Over the course of one year, tiny rootlets will develop where the stem touches the ground. At that point, the rooted portion may be severed from the mother plant and carefully tended.
Cuttings rooted in rooting hormone has a lower success rate but nonetheless may be a viable option of reproducing this species. However, many state laws prohibit the unauthorized reproduction of any named cultivar without the prior consent of the original nursery that had developed the cultivar.
The pokeweeds, also known as poke, pokebush, pokeberry, pokeroot, inkberry or ombú, comprise the genus Phytolacca, perennial plants native to North America, South America, East Asia and New Zealand. Pokeweed contains "phytolaccatoxin" and "phytolaccigenin", which are poisonous to mammals. However, the berries are eaten by birds, which are not affected by the toxin.
Pokeweeds are herbs growing from 1-10 ft. tall. They have single alternate leaves, pointed at the end, with crinkled edges. The stems are often colored pink or red. The flowers are greenish-white, in long clusters at the ends of the stems. They develop into dark purple berries.
Pokeweed can be a troublesome weed of gardens and pastures. The fruits attract birds when ripe, and the birds then sow the seeds.
Young pokeweed leaves can be boiled twice to reduce the toxin, discarding the water after the first boiling. The result is known as poke salit, or Poke salad, and is occasionally available commercially. Many authorities advise against eating pokeweed even after twice boiling, as traces of the toxin may still remain. When fried in bacon grease, poke salad is no longer poisonous, and many say it tastes very good, "especially with cornbread". For many decades, Poke salad has been a staple of southern U.S. cuisine, despite campaigns by doctors who believed pokeweed remained toxic even after being boiled. The lingering cultural significance of Poke salad can be seen in the recording of the song "Polk Salad Annie" by Tony Joe White, famously covered by Elvis Presley.
Pokeweed is used as a homeopathic remedy to treat many ailments. It can be applied topically or taken internally. Topical treatments have been used for acne and other ailments. Internal treatments include tonsilitis, swollen glands and weight loss.
Pokeweed berries yield a red ink or dye, which was once used by Native Americans to decorate their horses. The red juice has also been used to symbolize blood, as in the anti-slavery protest of Benjamin Lay.
Pokeweeds are also grown as ornamental plants, mainly for their attractive berries; a number of cultivars have been selected for larger fruit panicles.Pokeweeds are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Giant Leopard Moth.
Phytopathology is the study of how disease processes develop in plants. These processes are of particular concern in the fields of agriculture and horticulture. There are several major groups of organisms that cause disease on plant, each of these are outlined below.
There are over 10,000 fungal pathogens of plants. The fungal plant pathogens themeselves fall into to major groups, the biotrophs which feed from living plant tissue and the necrotrophs which kill plant cells and then live off the nutrients released. However, many plant pathogens adopt a hybrid lifestyle, initially acting as biotrophs before converting to a nectrophic lifestyle. These are called hemibiotrophs.
The majority of phytopathogenic fungi belong to the Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycetes. 
The fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores. These spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soil bourne. Many soil bourne spores, normally zoospores and capable of living saprophytically, caring out the first part of their lifecycle in the soil.
Fungal dieases can be controlled through the use of fungicides in agriculture, however new races of fungi often evolve that are resistant to various fungicides.
The oomycetes are fungal like organisms that until recently used to be mistaken for fungi. They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the genus "../Phytopthora/" which includes the casual agents of potato blight and sudden oak death, and members of the genus "../Pythium/", which causes damping off of seedlings.
Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomyctes have developed very similar infection strategies and so many plant pathologists group them with fungal pathogens. The oomycetes are particularly difficult to control, and many can live in the soil as saprotrophs for long periods.
There are a few examples of plant diseases caused by protozoa. They are transmitted as zoospores which are very durable, and may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. They have also been shown to transmit plant viruses.
When the motile zoospores come into contact with a root hair they produce a plasmodium and invade the roots.
Most bacteria that are associated with plants are actually saprophytic, and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 species, are able to cause disease. Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world.
Most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod shaped (bacilli). In order to be able to colonise the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. There are 4 main bacterial pathogenicity factors:
1. Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes - used to break down the plant cell wall in order to release the nutrients inside. Used by pathogens such as Erwinia to cause soft rot.
2. Toxins. These can be non-host specific, and damage all plants, or host specific and only cause damage on a host plant.
3. Phytohormones - for example Agrobacterium changes the level of Auxin to cause tumours.
4. Exopolysaccharides - these are produced by bacteria and block xylem vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.
Bacteria control the production of pathogenicity factors via Quorum sensing.
"../Phytoplasma/" and "Spiroplasma" are a genras of bacteria that lack cell walls, and are related to the mycoplasmas which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the mollicutes. They also tend to have smaller genomes than true bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking insects, being transferred into the plants phloem where it reproduces.
There are many types of plant virus, and some are even asymptomatic. Most plant viruses have small, single stranded RNA genomes. These genomes may only encode 3 or 4 proteins: a replicase, a coat protein, a movement protein to allow cell to cell movement and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. 
Plant viruses must be transmitted from plant to plant by a vector. This is normally an insect, but some fungi, nematodes and protozoa have been shown to be viral vectors.
../Nematodes/ are small, multicelluar worm like creatures. Many leave freely in the soil, but there are some species which paratisise plant roots. They are mostly a problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where they may infect crops. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, whereas cyst nematodes tend to only be able to infect a few species. Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.

Phytopathology
Phytophthora infestans is a water mould, that causes the serious disease of the potato, late blight or potato blight. (Early blight, caused by "Alternaria solani", is also often called potato blight). This disease was a major culprit in the causation of the 1847 Irish potato famine and also the Highland potato famine. The organism can also infect tomatoes and some other members of the Solanaceae.
The spores of this water mould overwinter on infected tubers, particularly those that are left in the ground after the previous year's harvest, and are spread rapidly in warm wet conditions when blight can have devastating effects, destroying entire crops.
Spores develop on the leaves, spreading through the crop when temperatures are above 10°C and humidity is over 75% for 2 days or more. Rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers, or else spores can be blown in from distances of up to miles by the wind.
The early stages of blight are easily missed, and not all plants are affected at once. Symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant stems. White mould will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse. Infected tubers develop grey or dark patches that are reddish brown beneath the skin, and quickly decay to a foul-smelling mush caused by the infestation of secondary soft bacterial rots. Seemingly healthy tubers may rot later when in store.
Up until the 1970s, there was only one type of blight (A1) in the UK, and this was unable to produce resistant spores that could survive the winter. There are now two types (A1 and A2) which can mate and after that produce resistant spores, although the indications so far are that this rarely, if ever, happens in the UK. Mating can occur only between moulds of different mating-types and is required for the production of resistant spores.
Prevention and control of potato blight can be achieved by planting only good quality seeds obtained from certified suppliers. Do not save your own seed for replanting, and try to ensure that no ‘volunteer’ tubers are left in the soil after harvest. Potato varieties vary in their susceptibility to blight. Most early varieties are very prone; so that the crop matures before blight starts (usually in July) plant them early. Maincrop varieties which are very slow to develop blight include Cara, Stirling, Teena, Torridon, Remarka and Romano. Some so-called resistant varieties can resist some strains of the blight and not others, so their performance may vary depending on which are around.
Growing potatoes should be earthed up regularly in order to minimise the risks of spores being washed down into the soil reaching the tubers. If blight symptoms appear, remove all affected leaves immediately. Cut off and burn all foliage in bad cases to help prevent spread to the tubers. Don't harvest the crop for at least 3 weeks. By then, tubers will have thicker skins and blight spores on the surface will have died. A hot compost heap should destroy the spores on the leaves, but it is probably not worth the risk. Any infected tubers should definitely be burned.
The potato blight caused the Irish Potato Famine in 1845-49 which, it is estimated, caused over 1,000,000 to starve death and forced a further 2,000,000 to emigrate.
Phytophthora (from Greek phytón, “plant” and phthorá, “destruction”, “plant-destroyer”) is a genus of plant-damaging Protists of the "Oomycetes" (water moulds). Heinrich Anton de Bary described it for the first time in 1875. 
"Phytophthora" is sometimes referred to as a fungus-like organism but it is classified under a different kingdom altogether: Stramenopila (previously named Chromista). In contrast to Fungi, stramenopiles are more closely related to plants than animals. Whereas Fungal cell walls are made primarily of chitin, stramenopile cell walls are constructed mostly of cellulose.
"Phytophthoras" reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sporangia, zoospores, and chlamydospores are asexual. Oospores are sexual.
Infection by "Phytophthora" leads to root rots, cankers, foliar blights, and usually results in the death of the host plant. Symptoms vary according to both the pathogen species and the host species.
Phytophthora can live for long periods in the soil without the presence of a host. During wet contitions, the zoospores swim towards host plants following chemical traces. Once a plant is infected, it cannot be "cured", but may be sustained through foliar feeding for a time, depending on the host's natural resistance. 
Phytophthora is easily spread by infected tools, and is often introduced through infected nursery stock. Spores and vegetative tissues can also be spread by animals or wind.
"Phytophthoras" are mostly pathogens of dicotyledons, and are relatively host specific parasites. Many species of "Phytophthora" are plant pathogens of considerable economic importance. "Phytophthora infestans" was the infective agent of the potato blight that caused the Irish potato famine. Research beginning in the 1990s has placed some of the responsibility for European forest die-back on the activity of imported Asian "Phytophthoras". 
Plant diseases caused by this genus are difficult to control chemically, thus resistant cultivars are grown as a management strategy. 
The Small White ("Pieris rapae") is a small to mid-sized butterfly of the Yellows and Whites Pieridae family. It is also commonly known as the small cabbage white or just the cabbage white. It is native across Europe, North Africa and Asia but has also been introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand where they have become pests on cultivated cabbages and other mustard family crops.
In appearance it looks like a smaller version of the Large White. The upper side is creamy white with black tips to the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles. 
Its caterpillars can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, but it will readily lay eggs on wild members of the cabbage family. The eggs are laid singularly on foodplant leaves.
Known in the United States as "Imported Cabbage Worms", the caterpillars are green and well camouflaged. Unlike the Large White they don't store the mustard oils from their foodplants and so are not distasteful to predators like birds.
Leaves are eaten one side at a time, starting from the edge and often eventually reduced to just a stem and the base of the midrib. Seedlings may become completely defoliated after only a day or two. Greenish-brown frass may collect in the leaf axils.
Like its close relative the Large White this is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years. Like other "White" butterflies it hibernates as a pupa. Along with the Large White it is sometimes known as the Cabbage White or Cabbage Butterfly.
It has two flight periods, mid-spring and midsummer. 
Hosts include members of the following genera, and possibly other mustard-family weeds. 
Pilea pumila, known as Clearweed, Canadian clearweed, Coolwort, or Richweed is an annual plant native to most of North America east of the Rockies. The plants are generally erect, 10 to 70 cm tall, often occurring in large colonies, and are quite common throughout their range both as a woodland plant and a weed of gardens.
The foliage is opposite, simple with dentate margins, wrinkly (with depressed veins), ovate, and with long petioles. Both the leaves and stems are translucent and bright green, turning bright yellow in autumn. The flowers are small, borne in axillary cymes, unisexual with both genders occurring on the same plant, greenish yellow, and pollinated by wind. Flowers bloom from midsummer through early autumn. Fruits (achenes) are green with purple markings. Roots are fibrous, shallow, and adventitious off the stem in moist areas or when in contact with the soil.
This plant is most often found in rich, moist soils in both sunny and shaded locations.
It is sometimes grown as a ground cover for its attractive foliage, but this should be done with caution as the plant easily gets out of control, and can develops long-lasting seed banks if allowed to go to seed. They do form a heavy canopy, and so will keep other weeds down quite effectively.
It can also be grown as forage for deer and goats.
The Pine Sawflies are a group of insects that eat the needles of various species of pine. They feed as larvae in large colonies. They are often mistaken for caterpillars, but like all sawflies they are actually closer relatives to wasps and bees rather than moths and butterflies.
Because of their colonial habit, they can cause severe damage to individual pine branches, completely stripping the foliage and leaving only unattractive branches. They tend not to eat the buds, however, so the branch tips usually leaf out afterwards.
The larvae are generally greenish, found in large colonies. They "rear up" when a branch they are feeding on is disturbed, which is a defense mechanism that can scare off birds.
Found on pines throughout the landscape, with some species being preferred over others. The adults are good fliers.
Pine straw is a term used in the southern United States to refer to pine needles. A pine tree will produce pine needles that can be anywhere from 5 to 18 inches in length, the most desirable type of pine straw is referred to as Longleaf pine straw. These needles will fall to the ground and are then harvested for use as a mulch. 
Pine straw has been used mainly in the southern US in the past, but has more recently become available in other parts of North America as well. Like regular straw, pine straw is lightweight and porous, so it can be laid thickly as a weed barrier. It is also much slower to biodegrade, and has a better nutrient value. 
Its major liabilities include expense (in areas far from where it is harvested), and the strong acidity of the needles as they break down (though this is actually an asset when growing ericaceous plants and other acid-lovers). Pine straw can also make cleanup difficult, as fallen leaves and other debris tend to get stuck in a pine straw mulch, making it difficult to either rake or blow off debris without removing the mulch itself in the process. 
Pine Straw
Starting a new garden is a rewarding endeavor, but entails a lot of hard work and careful planning. 
Planning a Garden
Pest and disease management is one of the more difficult parts of gardening. The important thing is to know the pests, and how to control them.
Plant Pests and Diseases
Plant Pests and Diseases
The Broadleaf Plantain or Greater Plantago ("Plantago major") is a member of the plantago family, ../Plantaginaceae/. In North America, this plant is primarily a weed, though it is edible and is used in herbal medicine. The plant is native to Europe, and is believed to be one of the first plants to naturalize in the American colonies.
Plantain grows from a short, tough rootstock or rhizome, which has a large number of long, straight, yellowish roots, is a basal, rosette of large, broadly oval, dark green, leaves. The 4 to 10 inch long smooth, thick, strong and fibrous leaves have 3 to 7 or more ribbed veins, abruptly contracting into a long, petiole (leaf stalk) which is reddish at the base. The leaf margin is of Plantain is entire, or unevenly toothed. The flower stalks, are erect, long, slender, densely-flowered spikes. Each tiny flower is brownish and bell-shaped with four stamens and purple anthers. Flowers bloom most of the summer. The fruit is a two-celled capsule and containing four to sixteen seeds. Harvest fresh young edible leaves in spring. Gather Plantain after flower spike forms, dry for later herb use.
This plant does best in compacted soils, and hence is sometimes called "roadweed". It propagates primarily by seeds, which are held on the long, narrow spikes which rise well above the foliage. 
The Plant is commonly found on field boundaries as it is tolerant to pestcides and herbicides. It is wind-pollenated, and a cause of summer allergies when in flower.
Some cultivars of this plant are used in gardens.
Crushed leaves can be applied directly to the skin to stop bleeding, bee stings and insect bites. Psyllium seeds are a bulk laxative.
The leaves are completely edible, but can be somewhat tough. The taste is that of very bitter salad greens with a lingering aftertaste like spinach. Young leaves are recommended as they are more tender. The leaves when dried make a good tea. The sinews from the broadleaf plantain are very pliable and tough when fresh and/or wettened, and can be used to make small cords or braiding. When dry the sinews harden but also become more brittle.
There’s just nothing so spectacular in the early spring as a lawn planted with small bulbs for a colorful show. While very large lawns look good with larger bulbs such as daffodils, the average lawn owner wouldn’t want to wait that long to mow. This easy method is intended for use with the small spring bulbs, such as Crocus, the smaller grape hyacinths (Muscari), siberian squill (Scilla), early snowdrops (Galanthus), and the native spring beauties (Claytonia).
This sort of planting gives great results the following spring, and then even more over the long term, as the bulbs multiply and make the bloom more dense over time. 
The best effect is achieved by planting a large number of bulbs...I prefer to have at least 2 bulbs per square foot of lawn (so for a 20’ X 25’ area, I order 1,000 bulbs). They’re really not all that expensive wholesale, and can be installed in no time using this method. 
This all hinges upon the fact that most core aerating machines create holes the perfect size and depth for installing small bulbs (it won’t work with larger bulbs, which require larger, deeper holes). It’s not an appropriate thing to do on wet lawns, as bulbs won’t survive in very wet soils. The method works very well in combination with my Big Lawn Treatment in the fall. 
Preparation:
There’s really not a lot of preparation to do, just have the bulbs ready to go, and make up the fertilizer mix for the holes. To make the mix, stir in about 1 lb of bone meal with 6 cubic feet of compost (a full wheelbarrow). That doesn’t sound like much, but the compost naturally has most of the nutrients the bulbs need. If you have eggshells saved up, use about a quart of crushed eggshells into the mixture and skip the bone meal (it never hurts to add more eggshells if you have a large supply).
Equipment:
Core Aerator 
Packing Rod (just a stick or piece of handle to pack down the compost mix over top of the bulb)
Materials:
Bulbs
Bone Meal/Compost Mix or Eggshell/Compost Mix
Step 1: Run the Aerator
Run the aerator over the entire area to be planted. To make the blooms more randomly spaced, you can certainly run the aerator twice (all the holes won’t be used in either case). 
Step 2: Clean up the plugs.
Though normally one would leave the plugs from the aerator to break down into the soil, I find them distracting when doing a bulb planting, as you might end up forgetting where some of the bulbs are if they’re laying amid the plugs. 
Step 3: Place the bulbs
Don’t just start planting, because once the bulbs are in the ground, it's easy to forget where you’ve already planted, and where you still need to work. Place the bulbs around, on the grass, to get an even distribution. Try to avoid planting in rows or in a regular “grid”, since it looks much nicer if they’re a bit more randomly spaced, which gives the blooming lawn a “natural look”.
Step 4: Plant the bulbs
This is the easy part. Just put a pinch of the mix in the bottom of the hole, stick a bulb in, and firmly pack in more mix over top, bringing it up to the level of the soil. 
Step 5: Help the rest of the lawn
Either do a big lawn treatment, or just add some grass seed (fall is the time to do that anyway), and water well.

The Fourlined Plant Bug is a pest of many food crops and ornamental species, capable of causing serious damage if infestations are heavy.
The adult has a unique appearance, with yellow and black striped along its back.
Foliar spotting, blotching, distortion, and leaf drop.
Pollination is likely the most overlooked aspect of gardening, and inadequate pollination often limits gardeners' production of fruits and vegetables; indeed many times the problem is not even recognized. Mis-information is also frequently promulgated, even by those who should be experts. A good understanding of pollination, and active involvement in the various aspects of pollination mark an up-to-date gardener.
Polygonatum odoratum, commonly known as Angular Solomon's-seal or Scented Solomon's-seal, is a plant species of the genus "Polygonatum". In Britain it is one of three native species of the genus, the others being "../Polygonatum multiflorum/" and "../Polygonatum verticillatum/".
"Polygonatum odoratum" is a colonizing herbaceous plant with alternate, simple leaves, on green stems. The flowers are white, borne in spring.
Variegated Solomon's seal ("P. odoratum" 'Variegatum') is often cultivated in shade gardens.
"P. odoratum" is used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is called "yùzhú" (玉竹).
Mile-a-minute weed (Polygonum perfoliatum), also known as Devil's tail tearthumb, Asiatic tearthumb, or Devil Shield, is an herbaceous, annual, trailing vine in the buckwheat family. 
It has a reddish stem that is armed with downward pointing hooks or barbs which are also present on the underside of the leaf blades. The light green colored leaves are shaped like an equilateral (equal-sided) triangle and alternate along the narrow, delicate stems. Distinctive circular, cup-shaped leafy structures, called ocreas, surround the stem at intervals. Flower buds, and later flowers and fruits, emerge from within the ocreas. Flowers are small, white and generally inconspicuous. The fruits are attractive, metallic blue and segmented, each segment containing a single glossy, black or reddish-black seed. 
Mile-a-minute weed generally colonizes open and disturbed areas, along the edges of woods, wetlands, stream banks, and roadsides, and uncultivated open fields, resulting from both natural and human causes. Natural areas such as stream banks, parks, open space, road shoulders, forest edges and fence lines are all typical areas to find mile-a-minute. It also occurs in environments that are extremely wet with poor soil structure. Available light and soil moisture are both integral to the successful colonization of this species. It will tolerate shade for a part of the day, but needs a good percentage, 63-100% of the available light. The ability of mile-a-minute to attach to other plants with its recurved barbs and climb over the plants to reach an area of high light intensity is a key to its survival. It can survive in areas with relatively low soil moisture, but demonstrates a preference for high soil moisture. 
The first records of mile-a-minute in North America are from Portland, Oregon (1890) and Beltsville, Maryland (1937). Both of these sites were eliminated or did not establish permanent populations of the species. However, the introduction of mile-a-minute somewhere between the late 1930s and 1946 to a nursery site in Stewartstown, York County, Pennsylvania did produce a successful population of this plant. It is speculated that the seed was spread with Rhododendron stock. The owner of the nursery was interested in the plant and allowed it to reproduce; unfortunately, subsequent efforts to eradicate it were not successful. The distribution of mile-a-minute has radiated from the York County site into neighboring states. 55 years after its introduction, the range for this plant in the United States had extended as far as 300 miles in several directions from the York County, Pennsylvania site. 
Mile-a-minute weed is primarily a self-pollinating plant (supported by its inconspicuous, closed flowers and lack of a detectable scent), with occasional outcrossing. Fruits and viable seeds are produced without assistance from pollinators. Vegetative propagation from roots has not been successful for this plant. It is a very tender annual, withering with a slight frost, and reproduces successfully until the first frost. Mile-a-minute is a prolific seeder, producing many seeds on a single plant over a long season, from June until October in Virginia, and a slightly shorter season in more northern geographic areas. 
Birds are probably the primary long-distance dispersal agents of mile-a-minute weed. Transport of seeds short distances by native ant species has been observed. This activity is probably encouraged by the presence of a tiny white food body (elaiosome) on the tip of the seed that may be attractive to the ants. These seed-carrying ants may play an important role in the survival and germination of the seeds of mile-a-minute weed. Local bird populations are important for dispersal under utility lines, bird feeders, fence lines and other perching locations. Other animals observed eating mile-a-minute weed fruits are chipmunks, squirrel and deer. 
Water is also an important mode of dispersal for mile-a-minute weed. Its fruits can remain buoyant for 7-9 days, an important advantage for dispersing seed long distances in stream and river environments. The long vines frequently hang over waterways, allowing fruits that detach to be carried away in the water current. During storm events the potential spread of this plant is greatly increased throughout watersheds.
In traditional Chinese medicine, mile-a-minute weed is known as "gangbangui" (杠板归), and is valued for its diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and other effects.
It may also be eaten as a sour-flavored leaf vegetable, although its relatively high content of oxalic acid means that it should be eaten in moderation, and avoided by people with kidney disorders, gout, or rheumatoid arthritis.
The Japanese beetle is a scarab beetle which is present throughout much or North America as an invasive species. It can be a devastating pest of both crops and gardens, especially as they tend to occur in large numbers.
As the name suggests, the beetle is native to Japan, where it is a relatively minor pest due to the presence of natural predators. The insect was first found in the United States in 1916 in a nursery near Riverton, New Jersey. It is thought that beetle larvae entered the United States in a shipment of Iris bulbs prior to 1912 when inspections of agricultural commodities entering the country began.
The larvae live in the soil, where they feed on roots, particularly those of turfgrasses. Adults emerge in early summer, feeding on flowers and leaves. Eggs are laid in late summer, and larvae begin feeding, burrowing deep to overwinter.
The Japanese beetle ("Popillia japonica") is a beetle about 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) long and 1 cm (0.4 inches) wide, with shiny copper-colored elytra and a shiny green top of the thorax and head. It is not very destructive in Japan, where it is controlled by natural enemies, but in America it is a serious pest to rose bushes, grapes, crape myrtles, and other plants. It is a weak flyer and drops several centimeters when it hits a wall. 
Japanese beetles have a curious, identifying defense; they lift their hind legs up in the air, even when simply approached. These hind legs are spiny, and the behavior is probably intended to ward off predators.
Adults skeletonize leaves and flower petals, leaving only the veins behind. Heavy infestations can completely denude even large trees.
Larvae eat the roots of grasses, causing dead patches in lawns as the tops die off.
The life cycle of the beetle is typically 1 year in most parts of the United States, but this can be extended in cooler climates; for instance, in its native Japan, the beetle's life cycle is 2 years long as a result of the higher latitudes of the grasslands required for the larval stage.
During the larval stage, the Japanese beetle lives in lawns and other grasslands, where it eats the roots of grasses. During that stage, it is susceptible to a fatal disease called milky spore disease, caused by a bacterium called milky spore, "../Bacillus popilliae/." The USDA developed this biological control and it is commercially available in powder form for application to lawn areas. Standard applications (low density across a broad area) take from 1 to 5 years to establish maximal protection against larval survival (depending on climate), expanding through the soil through repeated rounds of infection, in-host multiplication, release from killed host, and infection. Typically proper application can lead to a 15-20 year period of protection.
Soil-bound larvae are also susceptible to certain members of the nematode families "Steinernematidae" and "Heterorhabditidae". As with milky spore, commercial preparations of these nematode varieties are available.
The primary natural predator found in Japan is the w:winsome fly ("Istocheta (or Hyperecteina) aldrichi"), a parasitic fly. Attempts at establishing this predator in the United States have met with limited success, primarily in New England. Alternative predators have shown some potential at serving as biological controls, such as the w:Spring tiphia ("Tiphia vernalis") and w:Fall tiphia ("Tiphia popilliavora") from China and Korea. Also, certain birds (such as the meadowlark and cardinal) and small mammals are significant predators on the adult form.
On field crops such as eggplant, floating row covers can be used to exclude the beetles, however this may necessitate hand pollination of flowers. Kaolin sprays can also be used as barriers.
Research performed by many US extension service branches has shown that pheromone traps may attract more beetles than they catch, and so they have fallen out of favor. Natural repellents include catnip, chives, garlic, and tansy, as well as the remains of dead beetles.
Reducing the ground until completely free from root-weeds helps in potato husbandry; though in many seasons one cannot complete these operations without losing the proper time for planting, which never ought to come after the first of May, if circumstances do not absolutely prevent it.
Cutting the seed into small slips does not provide any advantage, for the strength of the stem at the outset depends in direct proportion upon the vigor and power of the seed-plant. Accordingly, make the seed plant large, rarely smaller than the fourth-part of the potato; and in the case of small seed-potatoes one may profitably use half of the potato. At all events, rather err in using over-large seed than in making it too small; because, by the first error, no great loss can ever be sustained; whereas, by the other, a feeble and late crop may result. With properly cut seed, it requires from ten to twelve hundredweight of potatoes to plant an acre (1.2 to 1.5 t/ha) of ground, where the rows lie twenty-seven inches (700 mm) apart; but this quantity depends greatly upon the size of the potatoes used; large potatoes may require a greater weight, but the extra quantity will abundantly pay off in the superiority of the crop which large seed usually produces.
Cultivation should go twelve inches deep, if the soil will allow it; after this, the gardener should open a hole (about six inches (150 mm) deep and not more than twelve inches (300 mm) in diameter).
 There are two common alternate methods of growing potatoes by the amateur gardener. The first is container growing. One seed potato should be placed 15cm (6in) deep in a container which is 30cm (1ft) or more in diameter. Normal potting compost can be used. The amount of potatoes will obviously be small, but it's fun for the small garden.
The second method is to cover the planting area for early varieties with black polythene, simply held down with earth or bricks. The potatoes are planted at normal depth by cutting a '+' shaped hole in the plastic and planting with a trowel. The advantages are that the soil is warmed by the black polythene, giving the young plants protection from frost. The potatoes should be ready for harvest a couple of weeks earlier than normal.
Potatoes are ready for harvest when the foliage first starts to die and turn yellow. Early (new) potatoes can be lifted earlier (no earlier than June) to get the very tastiest potatoes. In this case, harvest them about a week after the potato plant flowers first appear. New potatoes only produce a couple of handfuls of potatoes per plant, so dig up the whole plant.
Maincrop potatoes will be ready for harvest in mid-Autumn (start of September at the earliest). For all potatoes, dig them up from the side of the ridge (a fork or spade are both fine) to avoid damaging the potatoes. The foliage can be placed on the compost heap only if it completely free from disease - if not, burn it. If you don't need all the potatoes from a plant at one time or if you want a few early in the season, simply burrow around the roots with your hands and remove the potatoes you need. The remaining potatoes will continue to grow.
Remove any soil clinging to the potatoes and leave them on the soil for a few hours to dry out - if they are stored damp, they will rot. Leaving them on the soil surface in the sun will harden the skin slightly, doubling the storage time - this is especially important for maincrop potatoes. Store the potatoes in boxes or sacks, checking them every few days, removing all but those in good condition. Damaged or blemished potatoes should be eaten immediately.
One word of caution, some potato flowers may well turn to berries which are definitely poisonous. Eaten in sufficient amounts the berries can be fatal. You may wish to remove them if children are likely to see them.
Store up potatoes for winter and spring use; and as one should keep them as long through summer as possible, make every endeavor to preserve them from frost, and from sprouting in the spring months. For frost protection, cover them well with straw when lodged in a house, and by a thick coat of earth when deposited in a pit; to prevent sprouting, pick them carefully at different times, when they begin to sprout, and dry them sufficiently by exposure to the sun, or by a gentle toast of a kiln.
Potatoes grown from stock certified as free from disease and planted in soil not occupied by potatoes the previous season, are relatively free from pests and diseases. The most common ailments to affect potatoes are potato blight (see next paragraph), scab, slugs, and wireworm. There is little protection available that can effectively solve these problems.
Potato blight has two phases - the first attacks the leaves, the second attacks the potatoes themselves. If your potatoes are attacked by the blight, there is no cure. However, cut the foliage back to 5cm (2in) from the ground at the first signs of infection. This will prevent the blight from getting to the potatoes themselves. With no foliage, the potatoes will not give of their best, but they will continue to grow for a month or so.
Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of garden plants. It is easily identified, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants will display white powder-like spots on the upper surfaces of the leaves and stems. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any part of the plant that shows above the ground. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and thicker, in many cases forming a solid mat over the entire infected surface. Severe infections can cause stunting, distorted foliage, leaf drop, and may eventually be fatal on some plants if left uncontrolled. 
Typically powdery mildew only occurs on the upper surfaces, a similar but unrelated group of fungi that grow on the lower sides of leaves are downy mildews.
The fungi that cause powdery mildews generally feed only on the epidermal cells of the plant, which they penetrate using organs called haustoria. 
In early spring, the overwintering bodies release spores which are spread by wind or water splashing onto the leaves and other plant parts. The fungi then spread over the plants' surfaces, while also penetrating the epidermal cells with haustoria, which are short, specialized hyphae. The fungi that cause powdery mildews generally feed only on the epidermal cells of the plant.
During the growing season the fungus continually produces conidiospores, which reinfect the plant or are spread to other hosts. 
Late in the season, specialized fruiting bodies called cleistothecia are produced, which either overwinter on the soil surface or release aeciospores, which infect the next years' buds. Cleistothecia are visible to the eye as small yellow to black dots.
The various species of powdery mildew affect a wide variety of plants in hundreds of genera.
Pre-emergent herbicides are substances applied to the soil that prevent the successful germination of weed seeds. Timing is important when using these, as the applicator needs to know when to apply them: if applied too early, they may lose their effectiveness by the time weeds are germinating, if applied too late the weeds will already have grown beyond the point where they are vulnerable to this treatment. 
Effective control of many garden pests can be achieved by either attracting or introducing predators, parasites, and parasitoids.
Protective Clothing
Pruning is a technique that is employed by gardeners in order to control growth, remove dead or diseased wood or stimulate the formation of flowers, which in turn lead to fruits. The most economical pruning is done early in the season, when buds begin to break, and one can pinch off the soft tissue with one's fingers (hence the expression "nipped in the bud"). Many home fruit growers make the mistake of planting a tree, then neglecting it until it begins to bear. But careful attention to pruning and training young trees will ultimately determine their productivity and longevity. Good pruning and training will also prevent later injury from weak crotches that break under snow or fruit load.
In order to obtain a better understanding of how to prune plants properly, it is useful to have some underlying knowledge of how pruning works, and how it affects the way in which plants grow.
Plants form new tissue in an area called the meristem, located near the tips of roots and shoots, where active cell division takes place. Meristem growth is aimed at ensuring that leaves are quickly elevated into sunlight, and that roots are able to penetrate deeply into the soil. Once adequate height and length is achieved by the stems and roots, they will begin to thicken to give support to the plant. On the shoots, these growing tips of the plant are known as apical buds. The apical meristem (or tip) produces the growth hormone auxin, which not only promotes cell division, but also diffuses downwards and inhibits the development of lateral bud growth which would otherwise compete with the apical tip for light and nutrients. Removing the apical tip and its suppressive hormone allows the lower dormant lateral buds to develop, and the buds between the leaf stalk and stem produce new shoots which compete to become the lead growth. Manipulating this natural response to damage (known as the principle of apical dominance) by processes such as pruning (as well as coppicing and pollarding) allows the horticulturist to determine the shape, size and productivity of many fruiting trees and bushes. The main aim when pruning fruit trees is usually to obtain a decent crop of fruit rather than a tree with an abundance of lush yet unproductive foliage. Unpruned trees tend to produce large crops of small, worthless fruit often damaged by pests and diseases, and much of the crop is out of reach at the top of the tree. Branches can become broken by the weight of the crop, and the cropping may become biennial (that is, only bearing fruit every other year). Overpruned trees on the other hand tend to produce light crops of large, flavourless fruit that does not store well. Pruning is therefore carried out to achieve a balance between shoot growth and fruit production.
Formative pruning of apple ("Malus pumila") and pear ("Pyrus communis") trees (stone fruits such as cherries, plums, w:gages, etc., have different requirements and should not be pruned during the dormant months) should be carried out during the dormant winter months between November and March (or 
June and September in the southern hemisphere) and during the early years of the tree's life in order to develop a strong framework capable of bearing the weight of the crops that will be borne in later years. This involves hard pruning, although in later years pruning will be lighter and carried out in order to encourage fruiting.
A maiden whip (that is, a one year old tree with no side shoots) should be pruned to a bud with two buds below it at about 80 cm from the ground immediately after planting in order to produce primary branches during the first growing season. A feathered maiden (that is, a one year old tree with several side branches) should have its main stem pruned back to three or four strong shoots at 80 cm from the ground. Side shoots should be shortened by two thirds of their length to an upward or outward facing bud. Lower shoots should be removed flush with the stem.
Remove any lower shoots and prune between three and five of the best placed shoots by half to an upwards or outwards facing bud in order to form what will become the tree's main structural branches. Remove any inwards facing shoots.
Prune the leading shoots of branches selected to extend the framework by half to a bud facing in the desired direction. Select four good laterals to fill the framework and shorten these by a half. Prune any remaining laterals to four buds to form fruiting spurs.
The tree will have begun to fruit and only limited formative pruning is now required. Shorten leaders by one third and prune laterals not required to extend the framework to four buds.
the tree is considered to be established and should be annually pruned as described in the following section.
Before pruning it is important to distinguish between spur bearing and tip bearing varieties. The former, which is the most common type, bear most of their fruit on older wood, and include apples such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin', 'James Grieve' and 'Sunset', and the pears 'Conference', 'Doyenne du Commice' and 'Williams Bon Chretien'. Tip bearers on the other hand produce most of their fruit buds at the tips of slender shoots grown the previous summer, and include the apples 'Worcester Pearmain' and 'Irish Peach', and the pears 'Jargonelle' and 'Josephine de Malines'. There are basically three types of pruning that are applied once the main shape of the tree has been established. These are:
Spur bearing varieties form spurs naturally, but spur growth can also be induced.
This also depends on the tendency of many apple and pear trees to form flower buds on unpruned two year old laterals. It is a technique best utilised for the strong laterals on the outer part of the tree where there is room for such growth.
This is carried out on the tree as a whole, and is aimed at keeping the tree and its environment healthy, e.g., by keeping the centre open so that air can circulate, removing dead or diseased wood, preventing branches from becoming over crowded (branches should be roughly 50 cm apart and spurs not less than 25 cm apart along the branch framework), and preventing any branches from crossing.
Tip bearers should be pruned lightly in winter using the regulatory system (see above). any maiden shoots less than 25 cm in length should be left untouched as they have fruit buds at their tips. Longer shoots are spur pruned to prevent over-crowding and to stimulate the production of more short tip bearing shoots the following year. Branch leaders are 'tipped', removing the top three or four buds to a bud facing in the desired direction to make them branch out and so produce more tip bearing shoots.

Okame cherry is a hybrid tree, which is one of the earliest cherries to bloom, and thus is often planted in parks and gardens. The name "Okame" is Japanese, referring to a woman who is often depicted in statues. 
More or less vase-shaped crown, densely covered in pink flowers before the leaves emerge in the spring.
Full sun to medium shade, often does fine under high canopies. The plant prefers deep, fertile soils. Somethat drought tolerant after established.
As a specimen or patio shade tree. Forces well, so can also be grown for cut flowers.
Pruning for crossing branches should be done every 2-4 years. The tree is often grafted, so basal suckers should be removed if present.
Generally grafted.
For forcing, cut branches just as the buds begin to expand. 
Usually problem-free. See "../Prunus/" for a list of pests and diseases. 
Prunus laurocerasus (Cherry-laurel or Laurel Cherry) is an evergreen shrub native to regions bordering the Black Sea in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe, from Albania and Bulgaria east through Turkey to the Caucasus Mountains and northern Iran.
It is an evergreen shrub or small tree, growing to 5-15 m tall, rarely to 18 m tall, with a trunk up to 60 cm diameter. The leaves are dark green, leathery, shiny, (5–)10–25(–30) cm long and 4-10 cm broad, with a finely serrated margin. The flower buds appear in early spring and open in early summer in erect 7-15 cm racemes of 30–40 flowers, each flower 1 cm diameter, with five creamy-white petals and numerous yellowish stamens. The fruit is a small cherry 1-2 cm diameter, turning black when ripe in early autumn.
"Prunus laurocerasus" is often called 'laurel' because of the similarity of foliage and appearance to the true laurel, "../Laurus nobilis/". However, the two plants are not related.
Over 40 cultivars have been selected, including:
"Prunus laurocerasus" has been widely planted as an ornamental plant in temperate regions worldwide, and has become naturalised widely in some areas. It is often used for screening, and also as a mass landscape and ground cover plant. Most forms are tough shrubs that can cope with difficult growing conditions (including shaded and dry conditions), and which respond well to pruning. The foliage is also used for cut greenery in floristry.
Unlike the rest of the plant, which is poisonous, the cherries are edible, although rather bland and with a somewhat astringent flavour compared to the fruit of apricots, true cherries, plums, and peaches, to which it is related. The seeds contained within the berries are poisonous like the rest of the plant, containing cyanogenic glycosides and amygdalin. This chemical composition is what gives the smell of almonds when the leaves are crushed.
Laurel water, a distillation made from the plant, has a pharmacological usage.
In some regions such as the Pacific Northwest of the United States, this species is an invasive plant. Its rapid growth, coupled with its evergreen habit and its tolerance of drought and shade, often allow it to out-compete and kill off native plant species. This reduces the overall diversity of ecosystems and impacts other plants and animals that live there negatively. It is also difficult to control once it has naturalised, because some species of birds eat the fruits and spread the seeds in their droppings.
The Black Cherry ("Prunus serotina", also occasionally Wild Black Cherry, Rum Cherry, or Mountain Black Cherry) is a large forest tree native to eastern North America from southern Quebec and Ontario south to Texas and central Florida, with disjunct populations in Arizona and New Mexico, and in the mountains of Mexico and Guatemala. It is a member in the subgenus "Padus".
Black Cherry is a deciduous tree growing to 15-30 m tall with a trunk diameter of up to 70-120 cm, occasionally more. The leaves are simple, 6-14 cm long, with a serrated margin. The flowers are in racemes, small (10-15 mm diameter), with five white petals and about 20 stamens, and are fragrant; there are around 40 flowers on each raceme. The fruit is a drupe, 1 cm diameter, green to red at first, ripening black; it is usually astringent and bitter to eat fresh, but sometimes sweet. The fruit is readily eaten by birds, which do not taste astringency as unpleasant.
Mature Black Cherry can easily be identified in a forest by its platy, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt potato chips. However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark resembles that of a Birch, and is thin and striped. It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling that of a Sourwood, and by an almond-like odor when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose.
Black Cherry is closely related to the Chokecherry ("../Prunus virginiana/"), from which it differs in the larger leaves and the cherries, which are black when ripe (hence the name), not red, though some populations of Chokecherry also produce black fruit.
The Black Cherry is a pioneer species. In the Midwest, it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight loving species, such as Black Walnut, Black locust, and Hackberry. It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting however only progresses slowly
There are two subspecies:
The typical subsp. "serotina" is sometimes further divided into four varieties, var. "serotina" in the east of the range, var. "eximia" in Texas, and vars. "rufula" and "virens" in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.
The fruit is suitable for making jam and cherry pies; they are also a popular flavoring for sodas and used in many ice creams.
The timber is valuable, perhaps the premier cabinetry timber of the U.S., traded as "cherry". It is known for its strong red color and high price.
The foliage, particularly when wilted, contains cyanogenic glycosides which convert to hydrogen cyanide if eaten by animals. It is recommended that farmers remove any Black Cherry trees that fall in a field containing livestock, because the wilted leaves could poison the animals. Removal is not always practical though, because Black Cherries often grow in very large numbers on farms, taking advantage of the light brought about by mowing and grazing. Entire fencerows can be lined with this poisonous tree, making it difficult to monitor all the branches falling into the grazing area.
Black Cherry is locally naturalized in parts of Europe, having escaped from cultivation as an ornamental tree.
Generally propagated by seed.
Wood is harvested when trees are mature (at least 24" diameter). Cherries can be difficult to harvest because of the height of the tree.
See List of Lepidoptera which feed on "Prunus". The ../Eastern tent caterpillar/ defoliates entire groves some springs.
Often the easiest and most effective way to control weeds is to simply pull them out by the root and dispose of them.
The first step in removing weeds from a garden is knowing which plants are weeds, and which are not. Inexperienced gardeners should always have an identification guide handy to help with this, or use on-line resources such as the on Wikiversity. Once identified, further reading will let the gardener know what kind of root system the weeds have, how they set seed, and whether they are safe to compost. 
Once the weeds are identified, the gardener should start pulling them out. If soil consitions are not conducive to getting the full root out (e.g., too dry or frozen), it's generally better to either change the conditions first (e.g., by watering) or just coming back another time, since most weeds will regrow from the root if only the tops are removed.
Many weeds will simply break off at the ground if pulled using a quick, jerking motion, so pull slowly but firmly to ease the whole plant out of the ground. If a root will not come out, either use a tool such as a hand cultivator or mattock to grub it out, or for large weeds (particularly woody ones), just cut it below ground level using loppers.
Never leave weeds in piles, either in the garden bed or on an adjacent lawn or other surface, since in many cases the seeds will continue to mature and disperse even after the weeds have been pulled. Most weeds can be composted, though if seeds are present heat composting may be required. Some weeds should simply be burned or sent to the landfill if they are particularly invasive.

Firethorn (Pyracantha) is a genus of thorny evergreen large shrubs in the family Rosaceae, subfamily Maloideae. They are native from southeast Europe east to southeast Asia, and are closely related to "../Cotoneaster/", but have serrated leaf margins and numerous thorns (Cotoneasters are thornless).
The plants reach up to 6 m tall. The seven species have white flowers and either red, orange, or yellow berries (more correctly pomes). The flowers are produced during late spring and early summer; the pomes develop from late summer, and mature in late autumn.
Pyracanthas are valuable ornamental plants, grown in gardens for their decorative flowers and fruit, often very densely borne. Their dense thorny structure makes them particularly valued in situations where an impenetrable barrier is required. The aesthetic characteristics, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a considerable alternative to artificial fences and walls
They are also a good shrub for a wildlife garden, providing dense cover for roosting and nesting birds, summer flowers for bees and an abundance of berries as a food source. Pyracantha berries are not poisonous as commonly thought; although they are very bitter, they are edible when cooked and are sometimes made into jelly.
San Jose scale is a pest of both orchards and ornamental plants. The insect is originally from China, but introduced in North America in the late 1900s as an invasive species.
Circular hard scales, generally in great numbers. Adult males are winged, females remain under the scale.
Severe infestations can kill the host plant if not treated.
Raised beds are garden beds which are raised above the level of the surrounding soil. They are used both in gardens and on small farms as a way of making gardens easy to work on, and as a way of preserving soil structure, since raised beds aren't meant to be walked on.
Raised beds are usually contained with a hard border such as logs, timber, cinder blocks, or even concrete. They are usually designed to be from 3 to 5 feet wide, which allows every part of the bed to be within arms reach for planting, maintenance, and harvesting.
Raised beds are particularly useful when there are drainage issues, stumps, or other problems with the soil.
Raised beds can be created at any time of year, including winter. 
Beds should not be too wide to reach across from either side
Inter-rows will need to be maintained. For small interrows mulches or gravel can be used. If interrows are to be maintained as turf, leave plenty of room for the mower, accounting for subsidence.
Logs should be as long as possible, at least 6 inches diameter. 
While dumping compost, buttress the siding logs with short logs or stone. Eventually use wedges.
When possible, build the beds when the soil is frozen or very dry to avoid rutting.
Add enough soil to leave a fairly high mound, as the compost will settle over time. 
When the logs rot away, either replace them or return the area to tilled soil for a time.

Lesser celandine, ("Ranunculus ficaria", syns. "Ficaria grandiflora", "Ficaria verna"), is a low-growing perennial native to Eurasia, but introduced into other parts of the world where it has escaped from cultivation.
Lesser Celandine is a low-growing, hairless perennial plant, with fleshy dark green, heart-shaped leaves. It is a spring ephemeral, meaning that the foliage dies down after seeds are set in early summer.
The flowers are yellow, turning white as they age. Ranunculus ficaria exists in both diploid and tetraploid forms which are very similar in appearance. However, the tetraploid type prefer more shady locations and frequently develops bulbils at the base of the stalk. These two variants are sometimes referred to as distinct sub-species, "R. ficaria ficaria" and "R. ficaria bulbifer" respectively. The plant is found throughout Europe and west Asia and is now introduced in North America. It prefers bare, damp ground and in the UK it is often a persistent garden weed.
In many parts of the northern United States and Canada, lesser celandine is an invasive weed. It can be a difficult weed to eradicate both in gardens and in woodlands or meadows.
According to Gilbert White, a diarist writing around 1800 in the Hampshire village of Selborne, the plants came out on February 21st, but it is more commonly reported to flower from March until May, and is sometimes called the "spring messenger" as a consequence. It is sometimes planted (or at least tolerated) for the early flowers and the glossy foliage.
The plant used to be known as Pilewort, as it was used to treat hemorrhoids. Supposedly the knobbly tubers of the plant resemble piles, and according to the Doctrine of signatures this resemblance suggests that pilewort could be used to cure piles. The German vernacular Scharbockskraut (Scurvywort) derives from the use of the early leaves, which are high in vitamin C, against scurvy.

Resistant varieties are plants within a certain group that are less vulnerable to attack by plant pests or diseases. In seed catalogs, these are often indicated by codes, which may vary from company to company. 
The use of resistant varieties is strongly recommended if pest or disease issues have arisen in the past.

Rorippa sylvestris (Creeping Yellowcress , Keek, Yellow Fieldcress; syn. "Radicula sylvestris" (L.) Druce ) is an invasive species ) in the United States.
Rosette-forming perennial with pinnatifid leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. Colonizes rapidly via underground rhizomes. 
Considered a noxious weed in parts of the United States.
Multiflora Rose (Rosa multiflora), is a species of rose native to China, Japan and Korea, but also present in other parts of the world as an invasive weed. It is particularly problematic for wooded areas and meadows because of its dense growth and copious thorns which make removal difficult.
It is a scrambling shrub climbing over other plants to a height of 3-5 m or sometimes higher in trees, with stout stems with recurved thorns. The leaves are 5-10 cm long, compound, with 5-9 leaflets and feathered stipules. The flowers are produced in long panicles, each flower small, 1.5-4 cm diameter, white or pink, borne in early summer. The hips are reddish to purple, 6-8 mm diameter.
In eastern North America, Multiflora Rose has become an invasive species, though it was originally planted as a soil conservation measure and as a wildlife attracting plant. It is readily distinguished from American native roses by its flower or seed heads, which bear multiple flowers and hips, often more than a dozen, while the native species bear only one or a few on a branch.
Over time this plant has become a serious ecological problem because of its ability to grow in diverse light, soil, and moisture conditions, and because its seeds are widely broadcast by birds. Once established, it forms nearly impenetrable thickets that displace native understory plants and can become a fire hazard in wilderness areas. Some places classify Multiflora rose as a "noxious weed". In grazing areas, this rose is generally considered to be a serious pest, though it is considered excellent fodder for goats.
Multiflora Rose is grown as an ornamental plant, and also used as a rootstock for grafting ornamental rose cultivars.
Because of the thorny, tough nature of this plant, heavy equipment duch as tractors or backhoes are often employed where possible. 
Rosemary ("Rosmarinus officinalis") is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant evergreen needle-like leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and in Uruguay. It is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae, which also includes many other herbs. The name derives from the Latin name "rosmarinus", meaning "dew of the sea". 
Forms range from upright to trailing; the upright forms can reach 1.5 m tall, rarely 2 m. The leaves are evergreen, 2-4 cm long and 2-5 mm broad, green above, and white below with dense short woolly hairs. The flowers are variable in color, being white, pink, purple, or blue.
Well-drained soils in full sun. Grows well in containers.
The fresh and dried leaves are used frequently in traditional Mediterranean cuisine as an herb; they have a bitter, astringent taste, which complements oily foods, such as lamb and oily fish. A tisane can also be made from them. They are extensively used in cooking, and when burned gives off a distinct mustard smell, which can be used to flavor foods while barbecueing.
Since it is attractive and tolerates some degree of drought, it is also used in landscaping, especially in areas having a Mediterranean climate. It can in fact die in over-watered soil, but is otherwise quite easy to grow for beginner gardeners. It is very pest-resistant.
Rosemary is easily pruned into shapes and has been used for topiary. When grown in pots, it is best kept trimmed to stop it getting too straggly and unsightly, though when grown in a garden, rosemary can grow quite large and still be attractive. It can be propagated from an existing plant by clipping a shoot 10-15 cm long, stripping a few leaves from the bottom, and planting it directly into soil.
Rosemary is a useful food preservative, according to research published in 1987 by Rutgers University, New Jersey. Researchers at Rutgers patented a chemical derived from rosemary that compares favorably with BHA and BHT in its preservative properties.
Rosemary can be added as an unusual extra flavoring in lemonade.
Rosemary has been found to be a stimulant and mild analgesic, and has been used to treat headaches, poor circulation, and many ailments for which stimulants are prescribed. 
It can be used as a disinfectant, as a mouth wash and to treat fever or rheumatism.
Externally it can be used in hair lotions; a few drops of Rosemary oil massaged into the scalp, then rinsed with an infusion of nettles can revitalize the hair. Used in this manner, it is supposed to prevent premature baldness. Rosemary is also reported to stop dandruff.
Hungary water was first invented for a Queen of Hungary to 'renovate vitality of paralysed limbs'. It was used externally and prepared by mixing 180g of fresh rosemary tops in full flower into a liter of fresh rosemary tops in full flower into a liter of spirits of wine. Leave to stand for four days then distill. It is also supposed to work as a remedy against gout if rubbed vigorously on hands and feet.
Rosemary has a very old reputation for improving memory, and has been used as a symbol for remembrance (during weddings, war commemorations and funerals) in Europe, probably as a result of this reputation. Students in ancient Greece are reported to have worn sprigs of rosemary in their hair while studying for exams to improve their memory, and mourners would throw it into graves as a symbol of remembrance for the dead. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Ophelia says, "There's rosemary, that's for remembrance".
Rosemary and its constituents carnosol and ursolic acid have been shown to inhibit the growth of skin tumors and to provide a natural anti-oxidant protection against skin cancer and photodamage.
Health Precautions: In some cases, rosemary can cause autoimmune diseases. Rosemary in culinary or therapeutic doses is generally safe, however precaution is necessary for those displaying allergic reaction, or those prone to epileptic seizure. Rosemary essential oil is a powerful convulsant; if applied to the skin, it may cause seizures in otherwise healthy adults or children.
Rosemary essential oil is potentially toxic if ingested. Large quantities of rosemary leaves can cause adverse reactions, such as coma, spasm, vomiting, and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) that can be fatal. Avoid consuming large quantities of rosemary if pregnant or breastfeeding.
Cut flowers off to encourage more leaf production. In hardiness zones below 7, the plant should be brought indoors in winter.
Most commonly propagated via stem cuttings.
Cut leafy stems (removing flowers, if present). Dry by hanging upside down in a dark area.
Rot is a symptom that can have many causes, such as bacteria, fungi, or nematodes. The organisms that cause rots can either be the primary infectious agent, or more commonly opportinistic organisms that enter through wounds or following infection by other pathogens. 
Rots are grouped by the part of the plant affected. 
Roundup is the brand name of a systemic, broad-spectrum herbicide produced by the United States company Monsanto. It is the most used herbicide in the world, and the top-selling agrichemical of all time. Monsanto developed and patented the glyphosate molecule in the 1970s, and marketed Roundup from 1973. It retained exclusive rights in the US until its US patent expired in September, 2000, and maintained a predominant marketshare in countries where the patent expired earlier.
Weeds and grass will generally re-emerge within one to two months after usage. Because of this mode of action, it is only effective on actively growing plants; it is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide. Due to the absorption being limited to foliage, soil-bound glyphosate is effectively inert.
The active ingredient of Roundup is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Glyphosate's mode of action is to inhibit an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the amino acids tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine. It is absorbed through foliage and translocated to growing points. 
The surfactants used in the Roundup products may cause health issues. Like all herbicides, Roundup should only be applied in accordance with all labeling and legal requirements.
The US Environmental Protection Agency, the EC Health and Consumer Protection Directorate, and the UN World Health Organization have all independently concluded that glyphosate is not carcinogenic.
The toxicity of Roundup has been questioned, not so much because of its active agent (glyphosate) but because of the inactive ingredients, including the surfactant polyoxy-ethyleneamine (POEA) . These components are responsible for "acute" toxicity to humans such as eye irritation. Ingestion of Roundup has been proven to cause diarrhea following extremely high exposures. 
Roundup has also been found by researchers at Texas Tech University to disrupt the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) which has a role in testosterone production in males .
Due to heavy use of the herbicide, and its glyphosate-tolerant counterpart plants, fears have arisen that repeated exposure and cross breeding may eventually cause unwanted plants and weeds that might mutate into Roundup tolerant forms effectively creating a superweed.
Rubus occidentalis is a species of "../Rubus/" native to eastern North America. The common name Black Raspberry is shared with the closely related western American species "../Rubus leucodermis/". Other names occasionally used include wild black raspberry, black caps, black cap raspberry, and thimbleberry.
"Rubus occidentalis" is a deciduous shrub growing to 2–3 m tall, with thorny shoots. The leaves are pinnate, with five leaflets on leaves strong-growing stems in their first year, and three leaflets on leaves on flowering branchlets. The flowers are distinct in having long, slender sepals 6–8 mm long, more than twice as long as the petals. The round-shaped fruit is a 12–15 mm diameter aggregation of drupelets; it is edible, and has a high content of anthocyanins and ellagic acid.
Black raspberries are high in anthocyanins. This has led to them being very useful as natural dyes and, since anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants, to a great deal of interest in them for their potential nutraceutical value. Extensive work has been ongoing at Ohio State University to evaluate their benefit for cancer treatment in mammalian test systems, and the first clinical trials on patients with esophageal cancer.
It is also closely related to the raspberries "../Rubus idaeus/" and "../Rubus strigosus/", sharing the distinctively white underside of the leaves and fruit that readily detaches from the carpel, but differing in the ripe fruit being black, and in the stems being more thorny. The black fruit makes them look like blackberries, though this is only superficial, with the taste being unique and not like either raspberry or blackberry. In much of the Mid-Atlantic United States, black raspberries are simply called "Blackberries", even though they are not. 
The center for black raspberry production is in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The main cultivar, 'Munger', is grown on about 600 ha (1500 acres). Other cultivars include 'John Robertson', 'Allen', 'Jewel', 'Blackhawk', 'Macblack', 'Plum Farmer', 'Dundee', 'Hanover', and 'Huron'. The plants are summer tipped by hand, mechanically pruned in winter and then machine harvested. The yields are generally low per acre and this is why the fruits are often expensive.
The species has been used in the breeding of many "Rubus" hybrids; those between red and black raspberries are common under the name purple raspberries; 'Brandywine', 'Royalty' and 'Estate' are examples of purple raspberry cultivars.
The berries are typically dried, frozen or made into purées and juices or processed as colorants. Two well known liqueurs predominantly based on black raspberry fruit include France's Chambord Liqueur Royale de France and South Korea's various manufacturers of Bokbunja.
Rubus pensilvanicus (Pennsylvania Blackberry or Wild Blackberry), is a thorny bramble native to eastern North America. 
The canes are green at first but then turning dark red, usually ridged, with copious straight spines. The leaves are compound, usually bearing 5 or 7 leaflets. The flowers are white with large petals, bourne in mid-spring. The fruits are large aggregates of black drupelets, thich are somewhat sweet and often used for jams and jellies. 
While rarely planted, the wild blackberry does provide showy flowers and fruits, and is attractive to songbirds and other wildlife. Like all "Rubus" species, it can serve as a host to diseases that can affect the cultivated types.
Curled Dock ("Rumex crispus"), also known as Curley Dock or Yellow Dock, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae, native to Europe and western Asia, but invasive in other parts of the world.
The mature plant is a reddish brown colour, and produces a stalk that grows to about 1 m high. It has smooth leaves shooting off from a large basal rosette, with distinctive waved or curled edges. On the stalk flowers and seeds are produced in clusters on branched stems, with the largest cluster being found at the apex. The seeds are shiny, brown and encased in the calyx of the flower that produced them. This casing enables the seeds to float on water and get caught in wool and animal fur, and this helps the seeds to spread to new locations. The root-structure is a large, a yellow, forking taproot. 
Curled Dock is a widespread naturalised species throughout the temperate world, which has become a serious invasive species in many areas, including throughout North America, southern South America, New Zealand and parts of Australia. It spreads through the seeds contaminating crop seeds, and sticking to clothing.
Curled Dock grows in roadsides, all types of fields, and low-maintenance crops. It prefers rich, moist and heavy soils.
It can be used as a wild leaf vegetable; the young leaves should be boiled in several changes of water, or can be added directly to salads. Once the plant matures it becomes too bitter to consume. Dock leaves are an excellent source of both vitamine A and protein.
The roots have also been used medicinally as an astringent, tonic, and laxative.
Rusts are a group of plant pathogenic fungi which both cause aesthetic damage and inhibit healthy plant growth. Individual rust fungi have very limited host ranges, but often alternate between two hosts as part of their life cycle.
Rusts are primarily foliar diseases, and the most obvious sign is the presence of the fruiting bodies on the leaves, which are brown or orange ("rust colored"). Further symptoms include yellowing and dying leaves, and overall weakness of infected plants.
Rusts are fungi of the order Uredinales. Many of these species are plant parasites. Some are superficially similar to the smuts, although their relation to each other is not clear. The taxonomy of Urediniomycota, as a whole, is in a state of flux. 
Many of the rusts have two or more hosts (referred to as "heteroecious") and up to five spore stages. However they most commonly reproduce via asexual spore production. Their spores are airborne and can travel great distances. They mostly cause foliar infections. 
The group received its common name from the fact that some species have a reddish spore stage, which resembles the corrosion process known as rust.
Rust occurs on many species of plant, but in most causes any one species of rust can only infect one species of plant. The following describes the infection process of asexual spores. 
When a rust conidia spore lands on a plant surface it needs to attach to it, or it would simply be washed off. First, weak, hydrophobic interactions are formed between the spore and the cutin of the plant cell surface. Then unknown signals cause the production of hydrophobic mucilaginous macromolecules called adhesins. These will stick the spore irreversibly to the plant surface. Once attached, the spore will germinate.
Rust fungi penetrate the plant by using the natural opening of the stomata, but first the growing germ tube must locate it. Rust fungi have evolved to more efficiently locate stomata by the use of thigmotropism. The germ tube grows in a random manor until it reaches a ridge between epidermal cells. At this point it will start to grow perpendicular to the ridge, greatly increasing its chances of locating a stomata.
The stomata is the site of appresorium formation, a structure that functions to both firmly anchor the fungus and aid in penetration. In the rust fungi appresorial formation is controlled by a process of thigmodifferentiation. Appresoria are formed when the germ tube detects ridges that match the dimensions of the stomatal lips of its host species. 
It has been proposed that this process is mediated by a mechanosensitive calcium ion channel that is located at the germ tube tip. This ion channel would transduce the stretching of the cell membrane caused by changes in leaf topography into ion fluxes that lead to changes in gene expression and appresorium formation.. This theory is supported by experiments that show that applying Ca externally to the germ tube causes differentiation.
From the appresoria an infection peg growns down into the plant and between the mesophyll cells.
Rust fungi are biotrophs, meaning they gain their nutrients from living cells. This requires a specialised entension of the fungi into a living plant cell called a haustoria. This develops from a haustorial mother cell. The plant cell membrane invaginates around the main haustorial body and the space between the two membranes becomes known as the extra-haustorial matrix. An iron and phosphorous rich neck band bridges the plant and fungal membranes and acts as a seal preventing the escape of nutrients into the plant apoplast. The haustoria contains amino acid and hexose sugar transporters and H-ATPases for the active transport of nutrients from the plant cell.
The rust fungi will then continue to grow and invade the plant until it is ready for sporulation.
Salvia guaranitica (Anise-scented sage or Hummingbird sage) is a species of sage native to South America, including Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. 
It is a perennial or subshrub growing 1-3 m tall. The leaves are ovate, 4-13 cm long, mint green, and anise-scented when crushed. The inflorescences are up to 25 cm long, with each flower 3-5 cm long in varying shades of blue, with a dark basal calyx 10-12 mm long. Flowering begins in mid summer and continues through late autumn.
Salvia guaranitica is only a perennial in USDA Zones 7 to 10, but can be perennial in cooler climates, if planted in sunny microclimate.
Deep, well-drained soils with adequate irrigation during drought periods. Water needs are low. In colder climates, the plant should be sited against a building or masonry.
Numerous cultivars have been selected, including:
"Salvia guaranitica" is a popular ornamental plant in mild areas where the temperature does not fall below −12 °C. It is most often planted in order to attract hummingbirds.
Prune to the ground in early spring, before new stems grow. Can be sheared to encourage bushiness. Staking is sometimes necessary. Excellent container plant.
Division or stem cuttings. In colder climates, it can be dug in early autumn and kept indoors either in a pot or in vermiculite for dormant storage. It's hardiness can be greatly extended if planted against a building or masonry to maintain higher winter soil temperatures.
See "../Salvia/" for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus "Salvia".
Soapwort ("Saponaria officinalis") is a common perennial plant from the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). Other common names are Bouncing Bet and Sweet William.
The Latin name is derived from the toxic substance saponin, contained in the roots. It starts producing a lather when in contact with water. The epithet "officinalis" indicates its medicinal functions. However, it acquired its common name through utility in cleaning.
Soapwort's native range extends throughout Europe to western Siberia. It grows in cool places at low or moderate elevations under hedgerows and along the shoulders of roadways.
In the northern hemisphere soapwort blooms from May to September, and in the southern hemisphere October to March.
The plants possesses leafy, unbranched stems (often tinged with red) grow in patches, attaining a height of 70 cm. The broad, lanceolate, sessile leaves are opposite and between 4 and 12 cm long. It's sweetly scented flowers are radially symmetrical and pink, or sometimes white. Each of the five flat petals have two small scales in the throat of the corolla. They are about 2.5 cm wide. They are arranged in dense, terminal clusters on the main stem and its branches. The long tubular calyx has five pointed red teeth.
Soapwort has various medicinal functions as an expectorant and laxative, but care should be taken when used as saponins may be toxic. An overdose can cause nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.
Despite its toxic potential, soapwort finds culinary use as an emulsifier in the commercial preparation of tahini halva and in brewing to create beer with a good "head". In India, the rhizome is used as a galactagogue.
Sawflies make up the suborder Symphyta, a group of largely herbivorous insects in the order Hymenoptera. This group is an artificial assemblage of superfamilies that are essentially the most primitive taxa within the Hymenoptera (some going back 200 million years).
Sawflies are distinguishable from most other Hymenoptera by the broad connection between the abdomen and the thorax "(see image)", and the caterpillar-like larvae (below). The common name comes from the appearance of the ovipositor, which looks much like the blade of a saw. This ovipositor, which is modified into a "stinger" in some members of the Apocrita, is not used as a weapon. Females use the ovipositor to cut into plants where they lay their eggs. A few species have long thin ovipositors used to drill holes deep into wood. Large populations can cause economic damage in cultivated areas and forests.
The larvae look like caterpillars (the larvae of moths and butterflies), with two notable exceptions; (1) they have five or more prolegs on the abdomen (caterpillars have five or fewer), and (2) they have two ocelli (eyes), instead of the caterpillar's six. Typical sawfly larvae are herbivorous, the group feeding on a wide range of plants. Individual species, however, are often quite specific in their choice of plants used for food. The larvae of various species exhibit leaf-mining, leaf-rolling, or gall formation. The larvae that do not feed externally on plants are grub-like, without prolegs.
Adult sawflies, except for those in the family Cephidae, have structures that latch onto the underside of the forewings to help hold the wings in place when the insect is at rest. These "cenchri", which are absent in the suborder Apocrita, are located behind the scutellum on the thorax. Adults of some species are carnivorous, eating other insects, but many also feed on nectar. 
The scale insects are small insects of the order ../Hemiptera/, generally classified as the superfamily Coccoidea. There are over 7,000 species of scale insects, all of which are parasites of plants, feeding on sap drawn directly from the plant's vascular system. 
Scale insects vary dramatically in their appearance from very small organisms (1-2 mm) that occur under wax covers (some look like oyster shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5 mm), to creatures covered with mealy wax. Adult female scales are immobile and permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized. They secrete a waxy coating for defense; this coating causes them to resemble reptilian scales, hence the name.
Scale insects feed on a wide variety of plants, and many scale species are considered pests. Some types are economically valuable, such as the cochineal and lac scales. Scale insects' waxy covering makes them quite resistant to pesticides, which are only effective against the juvenile "crawler" stage. However, scale can be controlled with horticultural oil, which suffocates them, or through biological controls. Soapy water is also reported to be effective against infestations on houseplants. Female scale insects, unusually for Hemiptera, retain their larval form at sexual maturity (neoteny). Adult males have wings but never feed and die within a day or two. The specifics of their reproductive systems vary considerably within the group, including hermaphroditism and seven forms of parthenogenesis.
Scales feed on a very wide variety of plants, though most of the particular species have fairly narrow host ranges. If the particular scale can be identified, part of the control strategy is to inspect the area for other host plants, since the scale insects do not travel very far.
Southern Blight is a serious fungal disease affecting a wide variety of both food crops and ornamental plants. Southern blight is a serious problem for both agriculture and the nursery industry, and is very hard to eradicate once established in a garden. 
Affected plants show signs including wilted leaves and soft, rotten crowns, often followed by the death of the infected plant. 
The fungus is microscopic when inside the plant tissue, but eventually the organism forms sclerotia, which are an asexual dormant body which are visible to the naked eye, and look like white, yellow, or brown mustard seeds.
The fungus overwinters as a sclerotium, which is a dense mass of hyphae with a hard outer shell. When Warm, humid conditions are present, the sclerotia "germinate", and infect plant parts. The pathogen is not systemic on the plant, so removing infected parts can help control the disease.
Screens are plantings used to block wind, sunlight, or views, and are an important feature in both landscapes and agriculture. 
Screens planted to block wind are in most cases large trees, with large conifers being the most common plants used.
Screens used to block views (called "privacy screens" when the objective is to prevent views from the outside) are usually evergreens, often maintained as high hedges. 
Screens
Seed Banking refers to populations of seeds in the soil over long periods, primarily applied to weeds. Many weeds create seed banks, which allow them to germinate even if the previous year's plants did not have an opportunity to set seeds.
Seed Banking
The selectivity of pesticides (including herbicides) refers to how narrow a range of organisms it kills. For example, some herbicides only affect broadleaf plants or grasses, while while others kill all plants (the latter type is called unselective). 
Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) is a very common wild flower in the family ../Asteraceae/ that is found throughout Europe, usually in dry, open places, and has also been widely distributed as a weed elsewhere. 
Alternative names include Cushag, Tansy Ragwort, St. James-wort, Ragweed, Stinking Nanny/Ninny/Willy, Staggerwort, Dog Standard, Cankerwort, Stammerwort and Mare's Fart. In the western US it is generally known as "Tansy Ragwort", or even more confusingly "Tansy", though its resemblance to the true tansy is superficial at best. This is a potentially dangerous misuse of names, since the true tansy has been used for culinary purposes.
Ragwort contains many different alkaloids, making it poisonous to animals. In theory it is also toxic to humans but the dose required would be enormous. Alkaloids which have been found in the plant are acetylerucifoline, (Z)-erucifoline, (E)-erucifoline, 21-hydroxyintegerrimine, integerrimine, jacoline, jaconine, jacobine, jacozine, riddelline, retrorsine, senecivernine, senecionine, seneciphylline, spartioidine, and usaramine.
Ragwort is of concern to people who keep horses, cattle, goats, and sheep. In areas of the world where ragwort is a native plant, such as Britain and continental Europe, documented cases of proven poisoning are rare. In other areas the plant may become much more invasive and constitute a problem. Although horses do not normally eat ragwort due to its bitter taste, if the growth is particularly dense or if it has been picked and dried out, and it is taken while grazing, the result, if a large quantity is consumed, can be irreversible cirrhosis of the liver. Signs that a horse has been poisoned include yellow mucus membranes, depression, and lack of coordination. Animals may also resort to the consumption of Ragwort when there is shortage of food. In rare cases they can even become addicted to it. Sheep, in marked contrast, eat small quantities of the plant with relish and without apparent harm. They seem to profit slightly from eating it, according to some reports the alkaloids kill worms in the sheep's stomach.
The danger of Ragwort is that the toxin can have a cumulative effect. The toxin does not actually accumulate in the liver but a breakdown product can damage DNA and gradually kill cells. About 3-7% of the body weight is sometimes claimed as deadly for horses, but an example in the scientific literature exists of a horse surviving being fed over 20% of its body weight. However, because of the mode of poisoning is through affecting DNA molecules, very small amounts are unlikely to cause harm as they will be below the threshold to cause damage. The toxic breakdown products can also be metabolised by the liver before damage occurs. The effect of low doses is also lessened by the destruction of the original alkaloids by the action of bacteria in the digestive track before they reach the bloodstream. There is no known antidote or cure to poisoning, but at least one example is known from the scientific literature of a horse making a full recovery once consumption has been stopped.
Honey collected from Ragwort has been found to contain small quantities of jacoline, jaconine, jacobine, jacozine, senecionine, and seneciphylline. However these are unlikely to cause harm since the quantities consumed are below the harm threshold.
In the United Kingdom, Common Ragwort "(Senecio jacobaea)" is one of the five plants named as an "injurious weed" under the provisions of the Weeds Act 1959. The word "injurious" in this context indicates that it could be harmful to agriculture not that it is dangerous to animals, as all the other "injurious weeds" listed are non-toxic. Under the terms of this act, a land occupier can be required by the Secretary of State (DEFRA) to prevent the spread of the plant. However, the growth of the plant is not made illegal by the act and there is no statutory obligation for control placed upon landowners in general.
The plant is biennial or perennial. The stems are erect, straight, have no or few hairs, and reach a height of 0.3-2.0 meters. The leaves are pinnately lobed and the end lobe is blunt. The many names that include the word "stinking" (and Mare's Fart) arise because of the unpleasant smell of the leaves. The hermaphrodite flower heads are 1.5-2.5 cm diameter, and are borne in dense, flat-topped clusters; the florets are bright yellow. It has a long flowering period lasting from June to November. 
Sunny locations, adaptable to a wide range of soils.
Two subspecies are accepted:
Ragwort can be found along road sides and waste grounds, and grows in all cool and high rainfall areas. 
The Ragwort is native to the Eurasian continent. In Europe it is widely spread, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. In Britain it is listed as a weed. In the USA it has been introduced, and is present mainly in the North West and North East: California, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington.
In South America it grows in Argentina, in Africa in the north, and on the Asian continent in India and Siberia. It is widespread weed in New Zealand and Australia. In many Australian states ragwort has been declared a noxious weed. This status requires landholders to remove it from their property, by law.
Pollination is by a wide range of bees, flies, moths and butterflies. Over a season, one plant may produce 2,000 to 2,500 yellow flowers in 20- to 60-headed, flat-topped corymbs. This number of seeds produced may be as large as 75,000 to 200,000, although in its native range in Eurasia very few of these would grow into new plants and research has shown that most seeds do not travel a great distance from the parent plant.
From medieval times to the mid 20th century, Ragwort was used against inflammations of the eye, for sore and cancerous ulcers, rheumatism, sciatica and gout, for painful joints. According to some, it would relieve the pain of bee stings.
All applications should be external only, never internally, and only under professional supervision.
With the large range of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are known to inhibit or reduce cell division, some researchers hope to use them to slow down or arrest the growth of cells in cancer.
In ancient Greece and Rome a supposed aphrodisiac was made from the plant; it was called satyrion.
The leaves can be used to obtain good green dye, as yellow dye is obtained from the flowers, as can be done for brown and orange.
See "../Senecio/" for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus.
Groundsel ("Senecio vulgaris") is a cosmopolitan (world-wide) annual plant in the family ../Asteraceae/. It is a common weed of agricultural fields, gardens, and other areas of exposed and regularly disturbed ground. 
There are several other species of Groundsel, all of which are typically weedy but with usually more attractive flowers in as much as they have ray florets ("petals") around the margin of the flower head like most other members of the Daisy family.
Extremely variable in all its parts, the deeply toothed leaves and slightly fleshy stems topped with rayless, yellow flower heads ("capitula") and fluffy white seed heads are very familiar to gardeners everywhere.
This plant can grow from seed to seeding in only a few weeks and do so in all types of soils, damp or dry. The windblown seeds make its presence in the garden almost inevitable.
A good nectar source in the cold seasons.
Setaria is a genus of grasses, including some problem weed species.
The species share in common a "fox-tail" inflorescence.
Shredded Leaves are often considered to be the best organic mulch available for use in the garden. Leaves contain a great number of ../Nutrients/, are lightweight, and biodegrade quickly. 
The major disadvantage to shredded leaves is that they are almost never available commercially, so the gardener generally has to make them herself using either a leaf shredder or by running them over with a lawn mower.

Slugs are gastropod molluscs without shells or with very small internal shells, in contrast to snails, which have a prominent coiled shell. The loss or reduction of the shell is a derived character, and the same basic body design has independently evolved several times, making slugs a polyphyletic group. Although they undergo torsion (180 degree twisting of internal organs) during development, their bodies are streamlined and worm-like, and so show little external evidence of it. Slugs include both marine and terrestrial species. The soft, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation, so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments.
Some species of slug are notable garden pests, and can cause considerable damage to both leafy vegetables (especially the brassicas) and "fruit vegetables" such as ../Tomato/es. There are various methods of controlling them. Best results may be achieved by combining several of the methods mentioned below.
Slugs macerate food using their radula, a rough, tongue-like organ with many tiny tooth-like denticles.
Like snails, slugs have two pairs of 'feelers' or "tentacles" on their head. The upper pair--"optical tentacles"--are light sensors; the lower pair provides the sense of smell. Both pairs are retractable and can be regrown if lost. On top of the slug, behind the head, is the saddle-shaped "mantle," and under this are the genital opening and anus. The mantle also has a hole, the "pneumostome," for respiration. The slug moves by rhythmic muscular action of its "foot".
Among the various species of land slug are the grey field slug, "Deroceras reticulatus"; the garden slug "Arion hortensis"; the leopard slug, "Limax maximus"; and the banana slug, "Ariolimax columbianus".
Most slugs eat leaves, fungus, and decaying vegetable material, but some are predators and most also eat carrion including dead of their own kind. Frogs, toads, snakes, hedgehogs, and some birds and beetles are natural slug predators. Slugs, when attacked, can contract their body, making themselves harder and more compact and thus more difficult for many animals to get a hold of. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent.
Slugs produce two types of mucus: one which is thin and watery, and another which is thick and sticky. Both are hygroscopic. The thin mucus is spread out from the centre of the foot to the edges. The thick mucus spreads out from front to back.
Mucus is very important to slugs as it helps them move around, and contains fibres which prevent the slug from sliding down vertical surfaces. Mucus also provides protection against predators and helps retain moisture. Some species use slime cords to lower themselves on to the ground, or suspend from them during copulation.
Slugs are hermaphroditic: having both female and male reproductive organs. Once a slug has located a mate they encircle each other and sperm is exchanged through their protruding genitalia. A few days later around 30 eggs are laid into a hole in the ground. Although some species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, in other species, the adults die in the autumn.
A commonly seen practice among many slugs is apophallation, when one or both of the slugs chew off the other's penis. The penis of these species is curled like a cork-screw and often becomes entangled in their mate's genitalia in the process of exchanging sperm. Apophallation allows the slugs to separate themselves. Once the penis has been removed, the slug remains female for the rest of its life.
Various species of slug can also reproduce via tiny "darts" of sperm which they fling in the direction of their mate's genitalia.
Slugs feed on a wide variety of garden plants, including strawberries and lettuce.
Almost any soil will benefit from improvement, and the overall health of the garden both over the long term and the short will be greatly improved by having a good soil to grow from. As a rule, the simple answer to soil improvement is to incorporate composts. However, the soil may need particular improvements, as indicated in a soil test. The goal is to create a soil with good tilth, appropriate levels of available nutrients, a desirable pH, and in most cases good drainage.
Improving soil in a general sense (with or without a soil test) is a physically demanding yet crucial task in the garden. As an old saying goes, "a ten dollar plant in a twenty dollar hole will grow much better than a twenty dollar plant in a ten dollar hole." That saying might be misleading in some ways (current thinking is that putting plants in "good holes" has similar long-term effects as would planting it in a container), but improving the entire garden bed will indeed make for great plants.
The best way to improve most any soil is to add composts, because a soil with lots of organic matter will be much more amenable for growing plants.
Soil Improvement
Soil solarization is a technique for sterilizing soils using strong sunlight and plastic films to create a "greenhouse effect". 
Soil Solarization
Soil and root barriers are used to control weeds or limit the spread of an aggressive plant.
Surface barriers prevent any exposure to light (and sometimes water), or simply prevent plant shoots from reaching light.
Root zone barriers are vertical barriers that prevent the roots of plants from extending into adjacent areas, and are most often used for running plants such as mints and bamboos.

The goldenrods ("Solidago" spp.) are members of a genus of plants in the famile ../Asteraceae/, native to North America. They are commonly found as wildflowers in their native range, but some are also grown as garden plants. Some species are also rather serious invasives in other parts of the world. 
About 80 perennial species make up the genus "Solidago", most being found in the meadows and pastures, along roads, ditches and waste areas in North America, and a few have naturalised in Europe. 
The different species are difficult to distinguish. Probably due to their bright, golden yellow flower heads blooming in late summer, the goldenrod is often unfairly blamed for causing hay fever in humans. The pollen causing these allergy problems is mainly produced by ../Ambrosia/ (Ragweed), which blooms at the same time as the goldenrods, but the goldenrod pollen is too heavy and sticky to be blown far from the flowers.
They have slender stems, usually hairless but "S. canadensis" shows hairs on the upper stem. They can grow to a length between 60 cm and 1.5 m. The leaves are alternate, simple, and linear to lanceolate. Their margins are usually finely to sharply serrated. Flowers are small heads borne in large showy inflorescences.
The only common thread among the various species of goldenrods is that they require full sun. Otherwise, they are naturally found everywhere from road cuts to wetlands, and everywhere in between. Some species will "flop" if growing in overly fertile soils. 
In the garden, goldenrods are grown for their showy yellow blooms borne from midsummer to late autumn, depending on the species. Most plants are too coarse for garden use, but many cultivars have been selected for dwarf size and finer foliage.
Goldenrods bloom in late summer and early fall and some species produce abundant nectar when moisture is plentiful before bloom, and the bloom period is relatively warm and sunny. Honey from goldenrods often is dark and strong due to admixtures of other nectars. However when there is a strong honey flow, a light (often water white), spicy-tasting Monofloral honey|honey is produced. While the bees are ripening the honey there is a rank odor and taste, but finished honey is much milder. 
Goldenrods are a preferred food of the monarch butterfly during their fall migration southward, and can be planted to attract them.
Goldenrods divide easily, and can become weedy if allowed to go to seed.
Caution should be taken when planting goldenrods because they are allelopathic, and can kill neighboring plants. One species, "Solidago canadensis", is invasive in Germany and China, in part due to its allelopathic trait.
Sooty mold is a fungus which grows from the sugary honeydew secreted by aphids, scales, the whitefly, and other insects which suck sap from their host plants. 
The name itself is descriptive, as sooty mold is a black, powdery coating on the leaves. Look for sooty mold on new growth and leaves, since these insects prefer soft tissue. The fungus itself does little harm to the plant; it merely blocks sunlight and very rarely may stunt a plant's growth and yellow its foliage. Thus, sooty mold is essentially a cosmetic problem, as it is unsightly and can take over a plant in a matter of days or weeks.
Sooty mold affects ornamentals such as azaleas, gardenias, camellias, crepe myrtles, and laurels. Plants located under pecan or hickory trees are more susceptible to sooty mold because honeydew-secreting insects often inhabit these trees, and the honeydew can drip down to the plants below. 
There are several means of treating sooty mold. In essence, they all boil down to controlling the pest(s) secreting the honeydew on the plant. Without honeydew there is no sooty mold. 
Some options include:
The above treatments do not permanently stop sooty mold or the insects which secrete honeydew. It is best, if you grow plants prone to the fungus, to use these treatments preventively.
Sowing is the simplest (and often the least expensive) way to bring introduce new plants into the garden. Seeds can be sown directly into the garden ("in situ"), or in containers where they are grown to a hardy size for transplanting into the garden.
In large gardens and farms, seeds are almost always sown "in situ", to avoid the additional labor involved in transplanting. 
Hand sowing is the process of casting handfuls of seed over prepared ground: broadcasting. Usually, a drag or harrow is employed to incorporate the seed into the soil. Though labor intensive for any but small areas, this method is still used in some situations. Practice is required to sow evenly and at the desired rate. A hand seeder can be used for sowing, though it is less of a help than it is for the smaller seeds of grasses and legumes.
In agriculture, most seed is now sown using a seed drill, which offers greater precision; seed is sown evenly and at the desired rate. The drill also places the seed at a measured distance below the soil, so that less seed is required. The standard design uses a fluted feed metering system, which is volumetric in nature; individual seeds are not counted. Rows are typically about 10-30 cm apart, depending on the crop species and growing conditions. Several row opener types are used depending on soil type and local tradition. Grain drills are most often drawn by tractors, but can also be pulled by horses. Pickup trucks are sometimes used, since little draft is required.
A seed rate of about 100 kg of seed per hectare (2 bushels per acre) is typical, though rates vary considerably depending on crop species, soil conditions, and farmer's preference. Excessive rates can cause the crop to lodge, while too thin a rate will result in poor utilisation of the land, competition with weeds and a reduction in the yield.
Among the major field crops, oats, wheat, and rye are sowed, grasses and legumes are seeded, and maize and soybeans are planted. In seeding, little if any soil is placed over the seeds. In planting, wider rows (generally 75 cm (30 in) or more) are used, and the intent is to have precise, even spacing between individual seeds in the row; various mechanisms have been devised to count out individual seeds at exact intervals.
Open-field refers to the form of sowing used historically in the agricultural context whereby fields are prepared generically and left open, as the name suggests, before being sown directly with seed. The seed is frequently left uncovered at the surface of the soil before germinating and therefore exposed to the prevailing climate and conditions. This is in contrast to the seedbed method used more commonly in domestic gardening or more specific (modern) agricultural scenarios where the seed is applied beneath the soil surface and monitored and manually tended frequently to ensure more successful growth rates and better yields.

Spinach is an important leaf vegetable, now grown throughout the temperate regions of the world. It is most productive in cool seasons and climates, since heat will cause the spinach to bolt.
Spinach ("Spinacia oleracea") is a flowering plant in the family ../Amaranthaceae/, native to central and southwestern Asia. It is an annual plant (rarely biennial plant|biennial), which grows to a height of up to one metre. The leaves are alternate, simple, ovate to triangular-based, very variable in size from about 3-30 cm long and 1-15 cm broad, with larger leaves at the base of the plant and small leaves higher on the flowering stem. The flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green, 3-4 mm diameter, maturing into a small hard dry lumpy fruit cluster 5-10 mm across containing several seeds. 
Spinach is a cool-season crop, and so should be planted either in early spring (just as the soil warms) or in fall. Fall plantings will overwinter into spring for an early crop, and is also well-suited to winter greenhouses and frames.
Planting can be done "in situ", in cellpack, or in containers. It is well-suited for growing in flats only for baby greens production.
A distinction can be made between older varieties of spinach and more modern varieties. Older varieties tend to run up to seed too quickly in warm conditions. Newer varieties tend to grow more rapidly but have less of an inclination to run up to seed. The older varieties have narrower leaves and tend to have a stronger (although more bitter) taste. Most newer varieties have broader leaves and round seeds.
There are 3 basic types of spinach:
Rosemary Stanton, in her "Complete Book of Food and Nutrition", notes that silverbeet (or chard), is commonly referred to as spinach, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. Hence, there may be some popular confusion between the two vegetables.
The name "spinach" has been applied to a number of leaf vegetables, both related and unrelated to spinach:
In Indonesia, the word "bayam" is applied both to certain species of amaranth commonly eaten as a leafy vegetable, and to spinach, which is rarely seen, only in certain supermarkets but well known from Popeye cartoons.
Spinach is often harvested as a baby green or a cut-and-come-again crop. Baby greens can be harvested in as little as 2 weeks after germination.
Spinach loses much of its nutritional value with storage of more than a few days. While refrigeration slows this effect to about eight days, spinach will lose most of its folate and carotenoid content. This is worth considering when purchasing spinach out of season. If the product has been "in transit" (picked, cleaned, shipped and shelved) for more than one or two days it will need to be used almost immediately to have much nutritional benefit. This is in spite of the taste and appearance of the plant which may still seem fine.
Fresh spinach should be cleaned thoroughly and then can be stored loosely in an unsealed bag in the crisper tray of the refrigerator for a few days. Even at 4°C, spinach loses much of its nutritional value by eight days so for longer storage it should be fresh frozen, cooked and frozen or canned. Storage in the freezer can be for up to eight months.
Spiraea thunbergii (Thunberg's meadowsweet, Baby's Breath Spiraea, or "Thunberg's Spiraea"') is a plant in the rose family, native to Japan and China, and a popular landscape shrub in southeastern U.S.
"Spiraea thunbergii" is a small, long-lived shrub with thin, flexible stems. The flowers are white, borne in early spring (late March to early April) and late fall. It reaches a height of 1.5-1.8 meters (4-6 ft) and is about as wide. The alternate, simple, almost linear leaves are semideciduous.
Grows and flowers best in full sun.
This species forms an interspecific hybrid with "Spiraea japonica" L. fil. 
In the horticultural trade one can obtain several varieties of "Spiraea thunbergii", such as 'Mt Fuji' (white flowers), 'Ogon' (bright yellow flowers), 'Mellow yellow' and 'Fugino pink'
This plant produces phytotoxic cis-cinnamoyl glucosides and cis-cinnamic acid The plant-growth inhibition characteristics can be used against diverse species as lettuce ("Lactuca saliva"), pigweed ("Amaranthus retroflexus"), red clover ("Trifolium pratense"), timothy ("Phleum pratense"), and bok choy ("Brassica rapa" var "chinensis"). The characteristics of these natural chemicals indicate a potential role of cis-cinnamic acid and its glucosides as allelochemicals (chemicals, released from plants, that cause an interaction between plants and other living organisms) for use as plant growth regulators and weed suppression in agricultural fields and in natural ecosystems. 
Prune in spring just after flowers. Can be grown as a cutback shrub, or trimmed as a hedge.
Propagated by stem or root cuttings.
The beet armyworm ("Spodoptera exigua") is one of the most well-known agricultural pest insects. It is also known as the asparagus fern caterpillar, and the adult moth is known in the UK (where it is an immigrant and not known to breed) as the small mottled willow. It is native to Asia, but has been introduced worldwide and is now found almost anywhere its many host crops are grown. 
The wide host range of the beet armyworm includes ../asparagus/, ../bean/s and ../pea/s, sugar and table ../beet/s, ../celery/, ../cole crops/, ../lettuce/, ../potato/, tomato, cotton, cereals, oilseeds, tobacco, many flowers, and a multitude of weed species. The beet armyworm does not tolerate cold. It can overwinter in warm areas, such as Florida and Hawaii, but in colder areas it dies off during the winter and the region is reinvaded by the adult moth as the weather warms and crop plants sprout.
The caterpillars are greenish-brown cutworms, soft and bulging caterpillars with dark longitudinal stripes. The adult is a drab brown or gray moth 2 to 3 cm in wingspan.
The larvae feed on the foliage of plants, and can completely defoliate small ones. Smaller larvae devour the parenchyma of leaves, so that all that remains is the thin epidermis and veins. Larger larvae tend to burrow holes through thick areas of plants. For example, they will burrow straight into a head of lettuce rather than neatly removing tissue from one particular leaf. This renders the produce unmarketable. They attack buds and new growth on plants, preventing flowers from opening, new leaves from sprouting, and vegetables from developing. As the smaller larvae move about they leave strands of silk behind, netting the leaves with a silvery film.
Overwinters only in warm climates, but migrates during the growing season.
Spring cleanup is among the busiest times in the garden, involving both cleaning up anything that wasn't taken care of in the fall cleanup, as well as getting the garden ready for the new season.

Square Foot Gardening is a type of intensive gardening popularized by author and horticulturist Mel Bartholemew. It is based on the idea that the wide rows in conventional home gardening are a waste of time, work, water and space, and that more quality vegetables can be grown in less space with less effort. 
In this method, the garden space is divided into beds (a 4' x 4', 16 sq ft or 120cm x 120cm, 1.4m² garden being recommended) and separated by paths. These beds are further divided into squares of approximately one square foot, and planted with your vegetables. Common spacing is one plant/square for larger plants such as ../Broccoli/, ../Basil/, etc.. four/square for medium large plants like ../Lettuce/, nine/square for medium-small plants like ../Spinach/, and sixteen/square for small plants such as ../Onion/s and ../Carrot/s. The beds are weeded and watered from the pathways, so the garden soil is not compacted. 
Square foot gardening is especially compatible with:

The squash vine borer ("Melittia cucurbitae", often referred to as SVB) is a devastating and hard to control pest of cucurbit crops.
This insect is a diurnal species of sesiid moth that attacks both wild and cultivated varieties of squash and other members of the cucurbit family. The moth is often mistaken for a bee or wasp because of its movements, and the bright orange hindleg scales. The caterpillar is a grub-like borer.
Wilting of lower leaves and frass are the initial indications, quickly followed by the wilting and death of the entire plant.
The females typically lay their eggs at the base of leaf stalks, and the caterpillars develop and feed inside the stalk, eventually killing the leaf. They soon migrate to the main stem, and with enough feeding damage to the stem, the entire plant may die. The petioles of the lower leaves and stem should be monitored for entry holes and frass, which appear before damage becomes evident. 
Hosts include members of the family Cucurbitae, primarily the squashes ("../Cucurbita/").
The common chickweed ("Stellaria media") is a cool-season annual plant native to Europe. The plant germinates in fall or late winter, then forms large mats of foliage. Flowers are small and white, followed quickly by the seed pods. This plant flowers and sets seed at the same time, and the seed pods explode when mature to disperse the seeds.
Common chickweed is a low, mat-forming plant, present throughout the cool seasons and winter, but dying during hot weather. The roots are very fine, and the crown easily breaks away if pulled from very dry or frozen soils, allowing the plant to regrow.
In both Europe and North America this plant is an invasive weed of gardens, fields, and disturbed grounds. Control is difficult due to the heavy seed sets.
The plant has uses in folk medicine; 17th century herbalist John Gerard recommended it as a remedy for mange. It can also be tolerated as a winter soil cover.
Straw is an agricultural byproduct, the dry stalk of a cereal plant, after the nutrient grain or seed has been removed. Straw makes up about half of the yield of a cereal crop such as barley, oats, rice, rye or wheat. In times gone by, it was regarded as a useful by-product of the harvest, but with the advent of the combine harvester, straw has become almost a nuisance to farmers.
The most common use for straw is as bedding material for livestock, but it has a number of other uses as well. For the gardener, its most important use is as a mulch or as a bedding material to keep fruits such as strawberries or cucurbit crops off of the soil. Straw is a "cool" material (containing little nitrogen), and can be used fresh. Used straw from animal pens tends to be hot, and should not be used under food crops because of the risk of infectious organisms.
The biggest advantage of straw is that it is widely available and relatively inexpensive compared to other mulches. It also provides plentiful air and water circulation due to its texture, and can be laid thickly to discourage weeds. Its greatest liabilities are that it has a very low nutrient value, and its coarse texture and bright color is not universally appreciated by gardeners.
Straw bales can be used for controlling runoff (as a silt screen), and are often used as building materials for raised beds, retaining walls, and compost piles. Straw bales can also be used for making mazes and other playground features for children (in fact it is even used in constructing houses), and in some parts of the world is used roofing, for making beds for people, and as packing material.
Straw is also used to cover the ground when lawns are seeded, creating some shelter for the seeds by regulating humidity, preventing seeds from being washed away by water or wind, and confusing hungry birds. 
In Japan, certain trees are wrapped with straw to protect them from the effects of a hard winter as well as to use them as a trap for parasite insects.
Straw is used in ponds to reduce algae by changing the nutrient ratios in the water.
Still other uses include:
Stump grinding is the removal of tree stumps or roots using special equipment made for this purpose. 
The poppywort (also known as stylophorum, celandine poppy, wood poppy, or yellow poppy) is a member of the poppy family native to eastern North America, with yellow-orange flowers. 
The flowers are 4 showy sepals that are petal like, with many stamens in the middle. Plants grow about 1.5 feet tall, with pinnatifid shaped leaves. The flowers are produced in umbels that can have one to a few flowers each, the umbels terminate the stems and after blooming a pod like fruit is produced that hangs down under the foliage. When the seeds are ripe in mid summer, the pods split open along four valves. The plants have a yellow-orange sap that can stain hands.
 Plants are relatively long lived and readily self seed under garden conditions, were they are grown under part shade.
Maintaining a healthy population of trees in a suburban setting shares much in common with maintaining a "woodlot" or resource forest, but there are of course a number of differences as well. The best "wooded gardens" actually have relatively few large trees, since these areas are also expected to support small trees, shrubs, garden plants, and lawns. Managing these small woodlots takes planning and a realistic sense of what woodlands look like.
Natural woodlands are bound by the laws of ecological succession, where a disturbed area (in nature disturbed by fire or storm) will first be colonized by herbaceous plants and other "pioneer species" such as fast-growing trees and shrubs adapted to sunny environments. In many regions, the "mature" forest will be primarily one or a few species of climax trees, and a very sparse understory of ferns, mosses, ephemeral plants, and slow-growing shrubs: an ecosystem which is too sparse and delicate for regular use as an entertainment space for humans and their pets. 
Ecologically speaking, the goal in having a woodland garden is to "freeze" the ecological succession at the stage where there is a fairly extensive canopy (between 50% and 30% enclosed), which limits the amount of shade and water competition form the trees to allow us to have ornamental plants and lawns beneath. Maintaining that balance is a never-ending task, because the trees will continue to grow unless constantly suppressed. The main question is whether to prune or to cull the trees. 
In situations where the woodland garden was not planned in advance, there will often be decisions to be made about what trees to keep and what trees to remove. As a rule, it's best to remove trees as soon as they begin to pose a problem, because the trees will only get larger, more problematic, and more difficult to remove as they continue to grow or perhaps die (live trees are much easier to remove than dead trees).
1. Hazardous trees: Trees that pose an obvious hazard should be the first to go. Rotten trees and hollow trees are the most obvious, but a number of other factors can be just as important, such as trees from weak-wooded species, trees growing through utility lines, or even trees with dangerous fruits (such as walnuts, osage orange, or horse chestnuts and buckeyes if they are growing in an area where people, cars, or outdoor furniture is below). 
2. Diseased trees: Trees with serious diseases (such as "../Phytophthora/", "../Verticillium/", or other fatal diseases should in most cases be removed, unless there are no other trees around that could catch the disease and the garden owner would like to maintain a snag for woodpeckers and cavity-nesting birds. 
3. Invasive trees: Trees that are invasive in a particular region should in most cases be culled to protect the health of other trees and prevent seed production, although in some areas close to urban centers invasive species may represent almost all the trees present, and it may be better to keep some of them. 
4. Trees with bad growth habits: When trees are not carefully managed "from the start", they can often have growth habits that are aesthetically undesirable or in many cases will eventually become hazardous. Trees that have grown up underneath larger neighbors will often lean perilously, for example, and other trees may have dangerously narrow crotches. Removing these trees reduces the competition for the trees that will be kept, and helps prevent hazards later on. 
5. Overcrowded trees: The last step is to see if the healthy trees are competing with one another, and make a decision as to whether to allow them to compete, or pick the best specimens and cull the second best.
After any culling has been done, or if there are no trees needing culling, the next step is to prune the remaining trees to allow light to reach the ground and reduce the water consumption of the larger trees. Limbing up is often the best option, but other methods of structural or reductive pruning can be used if low branches are desirable.
If the trees are growing in a lawn, it is generally a good idea to create tree rings around the base of the trunks to prevent damage from mowing equipment. Small rings can simply be maintained as mulched soil, or larger rings can be created and plenatd with ground covers, shrubs, or herbaceous plants adapted to competition with tree roots.
Suburban Forestry
The Summer Squashes are a group of plants in the species "Cucurbita pepo", which are grown for their fruits. They come in many varieties among several major groups including: Yellow Summer, Zucchini, Crookneck, and Cousa. While there are some differences in flavor between these groups, their cultivation is essentially the same. 
Summer squashes grow on short vines, appearing bushy in the field. The leaves are large, palmately lobed, and usually variegated with white or pale green.
These plants are highly productive, particularly when the fruits are harvested while young: gardeners growing these plants often have plenty of produce to share with friends. The flowers are also edible and both male and female flowers are harvested for this purpose.
Summer Squashes grow in full sun or light shade. They require a rich soil for good fruit production.
Summer Squashes grow easily from seeds sown "in situ". Plants should be thinned to 18 to 36 inch (45-90 cm) centers. Seeds can be sown as soon as the soil warms up.
For growing transplants, sow 2 seeds per 3 or 4 inch pot. Seedlings grow quickly in warm weather, so should not be started before the planting area is prepared.
Transplants should not be broken up or have their roots cut unless severely rootbound. Soil may be mounded up to the lowest set of leaves.
Enrich planting area with composts, but not with manures, as too much nitrogen may reduce the fruiting.
Pick regularly to avoid over-ripening and encourage further fruit set.
If small fruits appear wrinkled or discolored, remove them (they may not have been pollenated).
Monitor for Squash vine borer.
Hill up composts to the lowest leaf set, adding more as the lower leaves yellow off (the small early leaves will die off naturally as the upper leaves shade them out). This provides both nutrients and some protection for SVB. 
Keep the growing area free of weeds, but maintain nectar sources nearby to ensure an ample supply of pollenating insects.
Burn borer-infected vines, and till area to disturb any coccoons. 
If rotation is not possible, use a winter cover crop such as rye, vetch, or pea to enrich the soil.
Cut the stems with a sharp knife. Summer squashes are best harvested well before the fruit matures, as the seeds become hardened in large fruit. Fruits can be harvested even before the flowers fully open if desired.
By seed, from the mature fruits. If collecting seed, allow the most productive plants to produce a single mature fruit towards the end of the season, picking it after the plant is frost-killed.
Powdery Mildew
Eastern Skunk Cabbage, Clumpfoot Cabbage, Foetid Pothos, Meadow Cabbage, Polecat Weed, Skunk Cabbage, or Swamp Cabbage "(Symplocarpus foetidus)", commonly known as simply Skunk Cabbage, is a low growing, foul smelling plant that prefers wetlands. It can be found naturally in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia and southern Quebec west to Minnesota, and south to North Carolina and Tennessee, and also in northeastern Asia, in eastern Siberia, northeastern China and Japan. It is the only species in the genus, although the genus Lysichiton is similar. Skunk cabbage is protected as a state endangered plant in Tennessee. 
The leaves are large, 40-55 cm long and 30-40 cm broad. It flowers early in the year; the flowers are produced in a 5-10 cm long spadix contained within a spathe, 10-15 cm tall and mottled purple in colour. It flowers in the early spring, when only the flowers are visible above the mud, with the stems buried below and the leaves emerging later. The rhizome is often 30 cm thick.
Its name is derived from its odor, which is rather mild as long as the plant remains intact. To fully appreciate why the plant is so named, one need only tear off a fresh leaf, releasing a pungent odor. While not considered edible, the plant is not poisonous to the touch. Though unpleasant, the smell is not harmful. The foul odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies, stoneflies, and bees. The odor in the leaves may also serve to discourage large animals from disturbing or damaging this plant which grows in soft wetland soils.
Skunk cabbage is notable for its ability to produce heat of up to 15-35° C above air temperature by cyanide resistant cellular respiration in order to melt its way through frozen ground, placing it among a small group of plants exhibiting thermogenesis. Although flowering whilst there is still snow and ice on the ground it is successfully pollinated by early insects that also emerge at this time. Some studies suggest that beyond allowing the plant to grow in icy soil, the heat it produces may help to spread its odor in the air. Carrion-feeding insects that are attracted by the scent may be doubly encouraged to enter the spathe because it is warmer than the surrounding air, fueling pollination. 
Eastern Skunk Cabbage has contractile roots which contract after growing into the earth. This pulls the stem of the plant deeper into the mud, so that the plant in effect grows downward, not upward. Each year, the plant grows deeper into the earth, so that older plants are practically impossible to dig up. It is thought possible that it may be able to live for hundreds of years. They reproduce by hard, pea-sized seeds which fall in the mud and are carried away by animals or by floods.
Does best in true wetlands, but can survive in moist soils. Full sun to fairly dense shade.
In the 19th century the U. S. Pharmacopoeia listed eastern skunk cabbage as the drug "dracontium". It was used in the treatment of respiratory diseases, nervous disorders, rheumatism, and dropsy. In North America and Europe, skunk cabbage is occasionally cultivated in water gardens. Skunk cabbage was used extensively as a medicinal plant, seasoning, and magical talisman by various tribes of Native Americans.
Easily propagated by division, though the plant is quite aromatic in the underground parts.
Leaf blights are frequent but not fatal.
Syringa vulgaris (Lilac or Common Lilac) is a large shrub in the olive family Oleaceae, native to the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe, where it grows on rocky hills.
Common Lilac is a very common ornamental plant in gardens and parks, because of the attractive, sweet smell of its flowers. Most garden plants are cultivars with flowers varying from white to dark lilac; some have double flowers with the stamens replaced by extra petals. The cultivar 'Aurea' has yellowish foliage. The majority of garden cultivars do not exceed 4-5 m tall. It is widely naturalised in western and northern Europe.
It is a deciduous large shrub or small tree, growing to 6–7 m high, usually multi-stemmed, producing secondary shoots from the base or roots, with stem diameters of up to 20 cm. The bark is grey to grey-brown, smooth on young stems, longitudinally furrowed and flaking on older stems. The leaves are simple, 4–12 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, light green to glaucous, oval to cordate, with pinnate leaf venation, a mucronate apex and an entire margin. They are arranged opposite pairs or occasionally in whorls of three. The flowers have a tubular base to the corolla 6–10 mm long with an open four-lobed apex 5–8 mm across, usually lilac to mauve, occasionally white. They are arranged in a dense, terminal panicle 8-18 cm long. The fruit is a dry, smooth brown capsule, 1–2 cm long, splitting in two to release the two winged seeds.
Common lilac does best in full sun, tolerating most soils except wet soil. Siting for morning sun and good air circulation can help reduce the occurrence of powdery mildews, which are a major problem for this plant in humid climates.
Numerous cultivars have been selected for size, flower color and form, and more recently for mildew resistance. 
Usually grown as a specimen, but also for cut flowers.
Tolerates harsh pruning, but should only be pruned immediately after (or during) flowering to ensure the next year's bloom. The shrub produces copious suckers, which may either be pruned out or encouraged. To encourage a "tree-like form, remove all suckers as they emerge, or to keep size limited remove the oldest stems every year to keep the height under control.
Propagate via cuttings or grafting to preserve follower color and form.
Flowers hold up well in the vase if the leaves are removed.

Systemic herbicides are chemicals that kill entire plants by traveling through the plants' vascular systems. 
The most well-known systemic herbicide is glyphosate, sold under the names RoundUp™ and Rodeo™.
Palestriped Flea Beetles are a pest of many food crops, and can also cause damage to ornamentals, particularly when the host plants are young. 
Adult beetle is yellow through brown or black with a paler stripe on each wing cover, and a red head. Like all ../Flea Beetles/, they jump away when disturbed. Grubs are long and thin.
Grubs cause root damage, particularly to tubers such as potatoes or sweet potatoes. Adults cause shotholing or skeletonized leaves, particularly of young plants.
Overwinters as an adult in debris.
A dandelion is a short plant, usually with a yellow flower head and notched leaves. A dandelion flower head consists of many tiny flowers. The dandelion is native to Europe and Asia, and has spread to many other places. The dandelion is also known by its generic name "Taraxacum". In Northern areas and places where the dandelion is not native, it reproduces asexually. 
The name "dandelion" is derived from the Old French, "dent-de-lion", which is literally "lion's tooth", referring to the sharply-lobed leaves of the plant. The English spelling reflects the French pronunciation at the time this French word was absorbed into English. The first written usage of the word occurs in an "herbal" dated 1373, but there is a 1363 document in which the word "dandelion" was used as a proper name (Willelmus Dawndelyon). 
In German, the "dandelion" is called "Löwenzahn", which is also translated as "lion's tooth." In modern French the plant is called "pissenlit", which means "urinate in bed", apparently referring to its diuretic properties. Likewise, "pissabeds" is an English folkname for this plant, and "piscialletto" is one of its folknames in Italian (with "dente di leone", meaning "lion's tooth"). Similarly in Spanish, it is known as the "meacamas", but also commonly "diente de león".
Taraxacum (the Dandelions) is a genus of flowering plants in the family ../Asteraceae/. They are tap-rooted biennial or perennial herbaceous plants, native to temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere of the Old World. 
The genus is taxonomically very complex, with numerous macrospecies, and polyploidy is also common; over 250 species have been recorded in the British Isles alone (Richards 1972). Some botanists take a much narrower viewpoint, and only accept a total of about 60 species.
The leaves are 5-25 cm long, simple and basal, entire or lobed, forming a rosette above the central taproot. As the leaves grow outward they push down the surrounding vegetation, such as grass in a lawn, killing the vegetation by cutting off the sunlight. A bright yellow flower head (which is open in the daytime but closes at night) is borne singly on a hollow stem (scape) which rises 4-30 cm above the leaves and exudes a milky sap (latex) when broken. A rosette may produce several flowering stems at a time. The flower head is 2-5 cm in diameter and consists entirely of ray florets. 
Away from their native regions, they have become established in the Americas, Australia and New Zealand as weeds. They are now common plants throughout all temperate regions.
Dandelions are so similar to catsears ("../Hypochoeris") that catsears are also known as "false dandelions". Both plants carry similar flowers which form into windborne seeds. However, catsear flowering stems are forked and solid, whereas dandelions possess unforked stems that are hollow. Both plants have a rosette of leaves and a central taproot. However, the leaves of dandelions are jagged in appearance, whereas those of catsear are more lobe-shaped and hairy. 
Other plants with similar flowers include hawkweeds ("Hieracium") and hawksbeards ("Crepis"). These are both readily distinguished by their branched flowering stems.
While the dandelion is considered a weed by many gardeners, the plant does have several culinary and medicinal uses. Dandelions are grown commercially at a small scale as a leaf vegetable. The plant can be eaten cooked or raw in various forms, such as in soup or salad. They are probably closest in character to mustard greens. Usually the young leaves and unopened buds are eaten raw in salads, while older leaves are cooked. Raw leaves have a slightly bitter taste. Dandelion salad is often accompanied with hard boiled eggs. The leaves are high in vitamin A, vitamin C and iron, carrying more iron and calcium than spinach.
Dandelion flowers can be used to make dandelion wine. The recipe usually contains citrus fruit. Another recipe using the plant is dandelion flower jam. Ground roasted dandelion root can be used as a coffee substitute. Drunk before meals, it is believed to stimulate digestive functions. Sold in most health food stores, often in a mixture, it is considered an excellent cleansing tonic for the liver.
Dandelion root is a registered drug in Canada, sold as a diuretic. A leaf decoction can be drunk to "purify the blood", for the treatment of anemia, jaundice, and also for nervousness. The milky latex has been used as a mosquito repellent; the milk is also applied to warts, helping get rid of them without damaging the surrounding skin. A dye can also be obtained from the roots of the plant. A new mixture of roasted roots is sold as a product called DandyBlend which tastes like coffee after the inulin in the dandelion is roasted.
"Dandelion and Burdock" is a soft drink that has long been popular in the United Kingdom with authentic recipes are sold by health food shops, but it is not clear whether the cheaper supermarket versions actually contain either plant.
This plant also is useful in farming, because its deep, strong roots break up hardpan.
Dandelion contains Luteolin, an antioxidant, and has demonstrated antioxidant properties without cytotoxicity.
The flower matures into a globe of fine filaments that are usually distributed by wind, carrying away the seed-containing achenes. This globe is called the "dandelion clock", and blowing it apart is a popular pastime for children. In German it's called a "Pusteblume", translated as "blow flower". The number of blows required to completely rid the clock of its seeds is deemed to be the time of day.
The flower head is surrounded by bracts (sometimes mistakenly called sepals) in two series. The inner bracts are erect until the seeds mature, then flex down to allow the seeds to disperse; the outer bracts are always reflexed downward. Some species drop the "parachute" (called a "pappus", modified sepals) from the achenes. Between the pappus and the achene, there is a stalk called beak, which elongates as the fruit matures. The beak breaks off from the achene quite easily.
As aforementioned, the taxonomical situation of the genus is quite complex, mainly because many dandelions are genetically triploid. An odd number of chromosomes usually is associated with sterility, but dandelions with this karyotype can reproduce without fertilization, a process called apomixis. In these individuals flowers are useless vestigial structures, although they may still produce a small percentage of fertile pollen, keeping some genetic contact with sexual individuals. Diploid dandelions develop seeds after cross-pollination and are self-incompatible. In most zones of southern Europe and Asia, dandelion populations are sexual or mixed sexual-apomictic, while in northern countries only triploid and tetraploid apomicts are present, as is in the zones where it is not native. This seems to be linked to higher temperatures, survival of pre-glacial populations and human impact, but the subject is still being studied.
There are usually 54 to 172 seeds produced per head, but a single plant can produce more than 2,000 seeds a year. It has been estimated that more than 97,000,000 seeds/hectare could be produced every year by a dense stand of dandelions.
Dandelions are used as food plants by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera.
Tarsonemidae is a family of mites, also called the thread-footed mites or tarsonemid mites.
Only a limited number tarsonemid genera, ../Steneotarsonemeus/, ../Polyphagotarsonemus/, ../Phytonemus/, ../Floridotarsonemus/ and ../Tarsonemus/, are known to feed on higher plants while most species in this family feed on the thin-walled mycelia of fungi or possibly algal bodies (Jeppson, 1975). Even among the plant-feeding tarsonemid mites, most are confined to areas of new growth where cell walls are thin and therefore easily pierced. However two species (broad mite and cyclamen mite) are able to feed on older leaves because of their ability to inject toxins during feeding (presumably of salivary gland origin) causing an increase of thin walled cells surrounding feeding sites (Jeppson, 1975). This proliferation of new growth often results in leaves that appear stunted, puckered and twisted (Jeppson, 1975). 
While little pest management research has been done on the majority of tarsonemid species, comprehensive studies have been made into the biological and chemical control of the cyclamen mite and the broad mite. Chemical trials demonstrated that ../Endosulfan/ and ../Dicofol/ consistently reduced densities of P. latus and P. pallidus (Rai, et. al, 2004, Sterk, et. al, 1997), and planting stock can be effectively decontaminated through fumigation with ../Methyl bromide/ or ../Ethylene dibromide/ (Jeppson, 1975). Three entomogenous fungi, "../Beauveria bassiana/", "../Metarhizium anisopliae/", and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, can effectively manage broad mite infestations, with B. bassiana providing the greatest reduction (Nugroho, 2004). Predatory phytoseiid mites, in the genus Neoseiulus, can also successfully control P. latus and P. pallidus under greenhouse and field conditions (Croft, et. all, 1998, Weintraub, et. al 2003).

Tetranychus urticae (an animal with over 60 common names, including "red spider mite" and "two-spotted spider mite") is one of many species of plant-feeding mites found in dry environments, and generally considered a pest. It is the most widely known member of the family Tetranychidae or Spider mites.
During the summer, "T. urticae" has a greenish brown appearance with two darker spots, but as winter approaches it gains a strong red color. Some populations are pemanently greenish or reddish, and these are considered different species of "Tetranychus" by some authorities. 
Tetranychus urticae is extremely small, barely visible with the naked eye as reddish or greenish spots on leaves and stems; the adults measure about 0.5 mm. The red spider mite, which can be seen in greenhouses and tropical and temperate zones spinning a fine web on and under leaves. The red spider mite is extremely polyphagous; it can feed on hundreds of plants, including most vegetables and food crops (peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, corn, strawberries) and ornamentals: roses, etc. It lays its eggs on the leaves, and it poses a threat to host plants by sucking cell contents from the leaves cell by cell, leaving very tiny, pale spots or scars where the green epidermal cells have been destroyed. Although the individual lesions are very small, commensurate with the small size of the mites, the frequently-observed attack of hundreds or thousands of spider mites can cause thousands of lesions and thus can significantly reduce the photosynthetic capability of plants, greatly reducing their production of nutrients, sometimes even killing the plants. Although this way of feeding could spread plant viruses, this is considered of secondary importance.
