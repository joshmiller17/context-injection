Conlanging is the art of creating languages. People create languages — conlangs — for all sorts of reasons: practical, theoretical, and artistic. This book will show you how. There are three parts, each aimed at a different level of experience; they are intended to be read in order, but more proficient readers may skip earlier sections.
The Advanced level of this book is for those familiar with the internal structure of the elements of language, who want to learn how to create sophisticated, unusual, and even really exotic conlangs. It aims to introduce you to language features and techniques that can be used to create conlangs with extra flair.
At the Beginning level, everything was fresh and exciting. We had something of an overview of the subject, because we didn't have enough details for us to lose track of the forest amidst the trees. At the Intermediate level, as we were learning the names for features of the landscape, the big picture got harder to see, and we were fighting a tendency for things to seem overly cut-and-dried.
Now we're at the Advanced level, and the character of this level is different again. While we can never fully recapture that sense of "wholeness" from the Beginner level, at this level things not only interconnect, but often seem to start bleeding into each other. There "are" folks who present a neatly ordered, cut-and-dried picture at this level, and they may explain — truthfully — that all their close colleagues agree on these things; but if so, it's because all their close colleagues belong to a close-knit school sharing that view. You may find other folks presenting ordered pictures inconsistent with that one; and the different schools may use different sets of advanced jargon, with similar-sounding names that sometimes mean very different things, or very different-sounding names for substantially the same thing.
This is the realm of "controversies". 
For conlangers looking to innovate, this can also be a treasure trove. Exactly "because" of the controversies, and the blurring of distinctions, there's wide-open scope for modifying, remixing, and repurposing features, breaking out of some molds altogether while creating fresh takes on familiar themes. It's certainly possible for an expert in a subject to get hide-bound, rigid in their thinking; but this is also where you can improvise new approaches that are not just different, but "persuasively" different.
Each section describes features and techniques in a different aspect of language design. The sections are:
This section covers advanced topics in grammar.
Way back at the beginning of the Intermediate level, we warned that the terminology we were about to introduce, analyzing the parts of language, was description of the form of language, not a recipe for building language — a map, not the territory. Now that we're up to advanced-level grammar, things get even more fraught. There is actually disagreement, often "heated" disagreement, between linguists who claim there are inviolable rules that human language must obey because those rules are hardwired into our brains as a built-in language facility — the "universal grammar" hypothesis — and linguists who... well, don't believe that.
The related descriptive idea of "linguistic universals" was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by linguist Joseph Greenberg. These are simply properties of human natlangs that appear to always, or at least usually, hold. A particularly famous one, which we touched on clear back in Beginner syntax, is that, of the three basic elements of a sentence, subject object and verb, in their default neutral order in any natlang the subject comes before the object. Although natlang exceptions do exist, it's unlikely you've heard of any of them unless you're a linguist — the exceptions that non-linguist English speakers might realistically have heard of are all conlangs (such as Klingon).
The "universal grammar" idea, that a built-in language-processing facility of the human brain determines how natlang grammar has to work, was advocated starting from about that same era by linguist Noam Chomsky, amongst others, and is sometimes known as Chomskyism. The heated controversy this idea can generate, on both sides, is also mixed with the question of whether language gives rise to meaning or meaning gives rise to language, with a side order of paleoarchaeology and how human language evolved in the first place. Adding spice to the mix, some linguists have blamed Chomsky's approach to grammar for a major shift of linguistics research away from field studies, thus depriving us forever of irreplaceable knowledge of natlangs that have vanished over the past half century; clearly that's not going to make Chomskyists and non-Chomskyists more friendly toward each other, either.
As a conlanger, you should keep two things in mind about these controversies:  (1) Know they're there, so you don't accidently step in them; and  (2) Good news! You don't have to take sides on any of it in order to conlang. There's no need for a conlang to adhere to principles of universal grammar "even if its author is a devout believer in universal grammar". For one thing, a fictional language might be spoken by people who aren't human anyway, so that it wouldn't matter what constraints do or don't apply to human language; but regardless of fictional background, or lack thereof, there's a vigorous tradition in conlangs of experimenting with deliberate violation of accepted rules. It's not about whether you believe the rules have to hold; if you're convinced they do have to hold, it can still be valuable or just plain fascinating to find out what breaking them would entail.
The parts of this section are:
Linguists classify natlangs according to how they indicate which noun arguments to a verb play what parts in the verb. Your conlang also has to indicate, somehow, which arguments play what parts in the verb — unless you're creating a "really exotically structured" conlang, where somehow you don't have a verb with arguments. We'll discuss language structures that play games with lexical/semantic classes like "noun" and "verb" in a later section; but meanwhile, if you're going to try to shake things up that much, you may find it helpful to understand, going in to that shake-up, how verb-and-arguments languages can work.
Knowing "how" a language aligns the arguments to a verb may say surprisingly little about "why" it works that way. We'll say a bit more about that in this section, but mostly we'll leave it for later sections, because it turns out that the reasons for alignment can be deeply entangled with a wide variety of other deep topics in language structure. It all tends to connect with how sentences fit into larger discourses. So in later sections we'll never be far away from alignment.
Keep in mind that when an area of linguistics is controversial or uncertain, that's an "opportunity" for conlangers to experiment and see what can work and how. People have looked at the overall arrangement of linguistic terminology in the area of "morphosyntactic alignment" (if you really think about the word "morphosyntactic", it seems to mean the same thing as "grammatical" only more academic-sounding), and concluded that linguists have little or no clue what's going on in this area. This is roughly what linguist Scott Delancey told a 2005 workshop on ergativity:
when we limit a collection to certain kinds of specimens, there is a question whether a workshop on "ergativity" is analogous to an effort to collect, say, birds with talons — an important taxonomic criterion —, birds that swim — which is taxonomically only marginally relevant, but a very significant functional pattern —, or, say, birds that are blue, which will turn out to be pretty much a useless criterion for any biological purpose.
— Scott Delancey, "The Blue Bird of Ergativity", 2005.
For classifying many languages, it's enough to identify three possible roles that a noun argument can play, relative to the verb:
Notice that "subject" is different, in that it really doesn't say anything about how the noun participates in the verb; in
"mouse" is the subject of "eats", and "cheese" is the subject of "is eaten" (yes, that's passive voice; grammatical voice is another complication, which we'll discuss in a later section). You might suppose that, here, "mouse" is an agent and "cheese" is a patient, even though each is the sole argument to an intransitive verb. We're talking, though, about the overall grammatical organization of sentences, and a lot of these fine semantic distinctions of noun usage just don't carry their impact that far: We can define some of the most common language types without going past S A and P, and when those three structural roles aren't enough, other language types tend to be described not in terms of a larger set of structural roles, but in terms of differences from the "simpler" types that only needed S A and P.
These three are sometimes called "core cases", to distinguish them from the wide variety of other cases — dative, instrumental, locative, etc.
The different alignment types are distinguished by the logical arrangements they use to keep track of the different noun arguments, but before we get into that it's worth a moment to look at the mechanics of the indicators they use. (We discussed a lot of this at the Intermediate level, of course, and in more detail; but now we want an overview from the perspective of alignment systems.)
The "generic" marking strategy is to inflect each noun to indicate its case, like Latin or Greek does. The word "case" may be used to refer specifically to a noun role in the sentence that is marked by inflecting the noun; someone using the word "case" that way would say that English doesn't have noun cases, by which is meant that it doesn't "inflect its nouns" for their role in the sentence. Other times you'll find the word "case" used more broadly for noun role indicated by whatever means, and then the same property of English would be described by saying noun case in English isn't marked by inflection. We'll use the word "case" here in the broader (some would say, looser) sense.
Another way to indicate case, then, is by word order; that's the way English does it (although some English prounouns are also inflected for case). Since this is syntax, where noun inflection would be morphology, the difference between an alignment system using inflection and one using position may be made by calling the latter "syntactic"; thus, the alignment used by Latin and Greek is "accusativity", while that of English is "syntactic accusativity".
It's also possible to put information about the nouns on the "verb". This may be redundant information that's also shown on the noun, as with English verbs that "agree" with the number of the nominative. (Curiously, the specific form of the nominative/verb inflection for number is usually a suffix "-s" that "moves" between the two, attaching to the verb when the noun is singular or to the noun when it's plural — a feature that, one suspects, might be much admired if it had been invented by a conlanger instead of occurring in a natlang; but, back to alignment.) However, the verb can be inflected for properties of one or another of its arguments that aren't shown on the nouns themselves. How you then determine which noun to apply which verb-marked information to, may then be determined by some other means — such as position, or some other marking that does agree between the verb and noun — or may simply be ambiguous; it's not uncommon for a language to simply leave some things unspecified, and speakers either figure it out from context, or occasionally misunderstand it, without thinking the ambiguity odd or unnatural.
There are also languages that inflect the verb with so much information about the nouns, that the nouns don't even have to appear as separate words; at the extreme, this turns into noun incorporation, and then into "polysynthesis" where — in theory — there are no separate noun words (we'll discuss polysynthetic languages in a later section). Things like polysynthesis are not, of course, switches that get turned on or off; there's plenty of room for disagreements about whether a given language is "truly" polysynthetic, or the like. The way the language actually works is what matters, and in nature is almost never pure, so if you're building an artlang (so you're not actually "trying" to produce an unnaturally uniform language), you may want things to work in an artfully impure way.
English has two noun cases for these three structural roles: "nominative" for intransitive subject and transitive agent, and "accusative" for transitive patient. Since English marks noun case mainly by word order — setting aside possessives, and excepting some of its pronouns — it's hardly surprising that the three structural roles S A P between them are served by only two cases; you can only mark two cases when the marking is simply before-the-verb versus after-the-verb. More interestingly, though, many languages that inflect nouns for case, such as Latin, also use a single nominative case for both subject and agent, and a separate accusative case for patient. Languages that use two case markings this way for the three structural roles are called nominative-accusative languages; accusative languages, or nominative languages, for short. Most Indo-European languages, as well as many others, are accusative.
Some languages split up these three structural roles into two marked cases in the other "obvious" way: by marking intransitive subject the same way as transitive "patient". Generally, the subject-patient case is called "absolutive", and the agent-only case is "ergative". The languages are called ergative-absolutive; ergative languages, or (occasionally) absolutive languages, for short. Ergative languages aren't so common; a notable example is Basque.
The distinction between accusative languages and ergative languages might sound superficial, saying — as the above quote from Scott Delancey suggests — nothing deep about the character of the language. However, even if it is superficial, it can be fairly far-reaching in the ways it interacts with other features of the language. For example, the passive voice we used above, "The cheese is eaten", is by natural affinity a nominative-accusative construct: It converts a transitive verb to intransitive by dropping the nominative argument — the agent — and changing the accusative argument to nominative. Ergative languages can have instead an "antipassive" voice, where transitive verb converts to intransitive by dropping the "absolutive" argument — the patient — and changing the ergative argument to absolutive. The reasons you would want to use these voices are different, and really only come into play when you consider large texts, of many sentences. We'll explore voicing in a later section; but it should be clear that how you arrange and use voicing will be all tangled up with noun alignment. Alignment also gets tangled up in the formation of relative clauses, yet another topic for a later section. So this alignment stuff may be superficial, but it does matter for how the language scales up to larger texts.
Ergativity was a big trend in conlanging a few years ago, possibly sparked by David Bell's artlang "ámman îar". Conlangers have also playfully noted, though, that having divided S A P into two cases by combining S and A, and by combining S and P, one might also try to combine A and P. With a transitive verb, you then wouldn't be able to tell which of the two nouns was the agent and which was the patient. This seemed such an absurd way to do things, they nicknamed it monster raving loony alignment. Except that they then discovered there's at least one example where a natural language actually "does" that, in a classic instance of anadew. Speakers would presumably cope with the agent/patient confusion by "common sense", considering the context; if it really became a problem for them, one might expect the language to change somehow to resolve the ambiguity — which would be, again, an alignment strategy.
Another straightforward way to handle the three structural roles S A P is to mark the three of them all differently. Languages that do this are called tripartite. Typically, the case of the subject is called "absolutive", agent "ergative", and patient "accusative"; so tripartite languages are sometimes called "ergative-accusative". Tripartite alignment is quite rare in human natlangs; examples include Nez Perce of North America, Wangkumara of Australia, and Semelai of Malaysia.
Some languages distiguish agent and patient by different cases — like both accusative and ergative languages do — but then may use either case for the sole argument of an intransitive verb. These are called active-stative languages; also called split intransitive languages; or active languages, for short.
Usually (to the extent these sorts of languages are usual at all), the case used with an intransitive verb depends on the verb — each intransitive verb requires a particular argument case. These may be called split-S languages. More rarely, a language may permit choice of intransitive argument case based on semantic considerations, so that the same verb can take either case; these may be called fluid-S languages.
Scattered examples of active-stative languages occur in the Americas (South, Central, and North), Austronesia, Tibet, the Caucasus, and Siberia.
Different parts of a single language may use different alignment systems; such a language is said to be split. Split-S languages are — arguably — an example of this, where the split is between a set of verbs that follow a nominative-accusative pattern and another set that follow an ergative-absolutive pattern. (You'll notice, though, that fluid-S is harder to fit into this notion of "split", while it also seems reasonable to group split-S and fluid-S together into a separate class of active-stative languages.) Pronouns — or at least some pronouns — are often handled differently; even in English, some pronouns (I/me, he/him, etc.) are exceptions to the general lack of core case inflections.
Languages are commonly split along verb tense or aspect. When that happens, the ergative verb form usually "isn't" present, future, or irrealis. This may have to do with language evolution, and how ergative patterns arise versus how verb forms arise. It's been suggested, for example, that the ergative past tense in Hindi arose because the past tense evolved from a passive voice, which moves the patient into subject role. (Future may sometimes evolve from some form of irrealis, too.) Split alignment can also occur along lines of "animacy", such as the first and second person pronouns — presumably the highest point in an animacy hierarchy — following a nominative-accusative pattern while the rest of the pronouns follow ergative-absolutive.
The term split ergative applies to a language with parts ergative and parts not — though not, typically, a split-S language. You may occasionally encounter the term split nominative, but not often, perhaps because nominative is much the most common alignment system while ergative is unusual.
Alignment can also be done using some internal property of the nouns. This occurs in some North American languages, which may have a robust "animacy hierarchy" for nouns; in Navajo, the two arguments of a transitive verb are positioned with the most animate first, where the most animate usually is the agent and an inflection on the verb indicates when the less animate noun is the agent instead. (Of course, you "could" interpret the same Navajo alignment scheme as using word order, with an inversion inflection for the verb, and a convention that the more animate noun has to come first. Whether that counts as "caseless" is an argument about terminology, as the language works the same way however it's described.)
Most verbs are either intransitive, with one argument, or transitive with two arguments; and we've been describing alignment systems in terms of how they treat those two most common kinds of verbs. In particular, which of the two arguments to a transitive verb is treated like the one argument to an intransitive verb.
But there may also be a class of ditransitive verbs, with three arguments; the three argument roles are then "agent", "theme", and "recipient". In English, we'd have
where the librarian is the agent, the book is the theme, and the student is the recipient. But the question is, of the theme and recipient, which of them is treated like the patient of a transitive verb? This is the same sort of question as asking which of the arguments to a transitive verb is treated like the one argument to an intransitive verb.
A language that treats the theme like the patient is indirective (though you won't encounter that term very much, as apparently most languages work like that). A language that treats the recipient like the patient is called by any of several names: secundative, primary object, dechticaetiative, and — believe it or not — anti-ergative. 
From the above example, apparently English is of the less common, secundative type: the recipient is treated like the patient of a transitive verb — positioned immediately after the verb — while the theme is treated in a new way, different from either transitive argument — positioned second after the verb. This is confirmed by what happens when this sentence is converted to passive voice, which drops the agent and promotes the patient to nominative treatment — which in English means the patient gets positioned before the verb.
This makes things sound very tidy, but language is generally organic rather than tidy. Consider the English sentence
and its passive form
What has happened here? The reduction of "The librarian gave the student the book" to "The librarian gave the book" is analogous to passive voice, except that instead of dropping the first argument (the librarian) and promoting the second argument (the student) to its place, this drops the second argument (the student) and promotes the third argument (the book) to its place. The passive form of this would then be "The book was given." Adding a prepositional phrase for the recipient to both of these produces "The librarian gave the book to the student" and "The book was given to the student."
Which may again seem tidy... but not everyone will agree that English is secundative, claiming instead that it's primarily indirective with some secundative mixed in (keep in mind, this is a question of how to describe the language, not how it works); and, more substantively, some dialects of English would say things like "The book was given the student by the librarian" (which most native English speakers would understand even though they mightn't say it themselves).
The Ergative alignment, formally known as Absolutive-Ergative alignment, is a rather common grammatical case system. Absolutive-Ergative differentiates between the Agent, it being marked in the Ergative case, from the Subject, with the fusion of both seen in Nominative-Accusative systems. The Absolutive case
marks the Object and Subject the same, often leaving them unmarked.
The Absolutive-Ergative system is almost absent in Indo-European languages which are by far mostly Nominative-Accusative. In Europe, the only Ergative language is Basque. Ergative languages are spread thinly throughout the world, with certain pockets that contain a high concentration of Ergative languages. While Absolutive-Ergative languages cover an area from north Canada to Tibet and Iran, one of the main concentrations are in the Caucasus languages (think Georgian), Australian ones, and Eskimo-Aleut. Other Ergative languages exist, and Tibetan is a good example.
Trigger systems are apparently found only in conlangs, inspired by the applicativization systems of like the Filipino language Tagalog.
In the case systems of English and other Indo-European languages, there's typically a subject (agent of the action), a verb (action) and an object or several objects (patient(s) of the action). Trigger languages on the other hand divide things into agent, patient and other objects.
The differences between "trigger languages" and "nominative/accusative languages" are:
Triggering works as follows: Every argument of the sentence is marked for its role (agent, patient, other objects). The triggered argument is marked on the verb. In Carsten Becker's conlang Ayeri, perhaps the best known trigger conlang, trigger and case marker change places.
A polysynthetic language is characterized usually by verbal inflections to the point that word order is largely free. Natlangs that are polysynthetic include Mohawk. It is common in North American Indian languages. There are few polysynthetic conlangs, like Bp@x’àãókxá, Noyatowa and Terpish.
A polysynthetic language generally marks the verb for the number, person, and class (if there are noun classes) of the subject, and sometimes the direct object. The verb is generally marked through affixes that may be prefixes or suffixes. The language may be agglutinative or fusional. In addition, tense, aspect, and any other information about the verb are usually marked on the verb.
Here's a hypothetical example:
In addition, it is frequent for polysynthetic languages to incorporate nouns. This means that the noun forms a compound with the verb. To illustrate again:
A great deal of explanation can be found here:
http://zbb.spinnwebe.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1253
Jeff Burke has written this description of polysynthetic languages:
Polysynthesis is a grammatical phenomenon most famously present in many North American Indian languages; the Algonquian and Iroquoian tongues are the most well-known. These languages, instead of using case endings on nouns and conjugational endings on verbs, mark both subject and object inside the verb; further, subject and object inflections are considered the actual arguments of the verb, while any free-standing nouns associated with a verb are like dislocated topic phrases. Here is an example from Mohawk, an Iroquoian language spoken in upstate New York and southern Ontario: 
Teiotahià:kton wá:keke’ 
Nominalized and rendered in normal English, this is 'I-ate a-banana'; but a more literal translation would be 'A-banana, I-ate-it'. The pronominals 'I' and 'it' (the arguments of the verb root -k- 'eat') are expressed via the prefix ke-, which indicates a singular first-person subject and a singular third-person object. ke- is, then, akin to noun case and verb conjugation fused into a single marker and attached to the verb. Mohawk has some fifty-odd of these pronominal prefixes that express subject-object combinations; and a prefix is mandatory on every verb. By contrast, the noun teiotahià:kton 'banana' stands in relation to the verb wá:keke’ only indirectly, as a topical phrase stands in relation to a central clause in English. 
Cheyenne, an Algonquian language spoken in southern Montana and Oklahoma, also marks subject and object on the verb, but does so differently; instead of a fusional marker, it uses a prefix for subject and a suffix for object. Witness: 
Hetane návóómo 
Literally translated, this means 'A-man, I-saw-him'. Hetane is the noun 'man' standing in relation to the verb návóómo 'I-saw-him' like a topical phrase. Ná- is the prefix for a singular first-person subject; -o is the marker for a singular third-person object. 
In addition to marking both subject and object inside the verb, polysynthetic languages often make use of noun incorporation. This is a phenomenon where a noun becomes, in essence, an inflection on a verb. Incorporated nouns can be, depending on the language and circumstances, direct objects, indirect objects, subjects, locatives, and of other kinds. Mohawk makes heavy use of incorporation, as in: 
Watia’tawi’tsherí:io 
This translates as 'It-is-a-good-shirt', where the noun root atia’tawi (a word that can be used to refer to basically any upper-body garment) is present inside the verb. Cheyenne also uses noun incorporation on a regular basis: 
Nátahpe’emaheona 
This verb, meaning 'I-have-a-big-house', contains the noun morpheme maheo 'house'. 
Noun incorporation can look bewildering, but is best understood in terms of English compounding. Babysit is an example of a word with an incorporated direct object; and words like deer-hunter and manslaughter make use of the same kind of incorporation."
The headmarking inflections can be better understood by thinking of Romance languages like Spanish, which inflects for details about the subject. Polysynthetic languages take this concept further and inflect the verb for details about the object as well.
Syntax is the how and why of sentence’s structured: the relationship between elements of a sentence and what those relationships encode. It’s the way a language organizes bits of meaning into representations of the world, of ideas, of situations, etc. Without syntax, there’d be no way of putting any particular meaning into sounds or symbols, and there’d be no way of getting a particular meaning out of sounds or symbols. In short, without syntax, there’s no language, just like without meaningful components there’s no language.
Some examples of word order affecting grammaticality:
Some examples of word order affecting meaning:
[Note: An asterisk before a sentence indicates ungrammaticality. A superscript question mark before a sentence indicates questionable or unknown grammaticality, or grammaticality to only some speakers.]
Syntax generally describes two things: where certain things can go, and what those positions mean. At this level we’ll be looking at various languages and comparing the different ways languages achieve the same thing. Later, in the advanced syntax tutorial, we’ll go back and attempt to find out if it’s possible to describe all languages using the same fundamental syntactic rules and structures, and why they seem to be so very different.
Unlike the simpler approach to syntax, this tutorial will be an in-depth look at linguistic theories. Where traditional approaches just discuss things like SOV vs. SVO vs. etc. word order, or such, this tutorial will explore the underlying structures and rules that produce those word orders. In the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll see how the rules we develop shed more light on the situation, and prompt us to throw out the simplistic notion of SOV vs. SVO vs. etc. word order as being a fundamental concept in syntax.
This tutorial will deal with some of the preliminary concepts used in syntax, primarily the structural components of sentences. As we’ll see by the end of the tutorial, we can account for a large number of features of languages with just this approach, but that we still miss a significant portion of what languages do in fact produce. The advanced syntax tutorial will take us into new territory, exploring a few different theories that aim to account for still more of language. Both this tutorial and the advanced syntax tutorial will be following the general structure of Andrew Carnie’s Syntax: A Generative Introduction (2nd edition), and could be considered a conlanger’s summary of that book. If you’re serious about understanding syntax from a P&P perspective, that book is highly recommended.
The parts of this section are:
So far we’ve explored the beginnings of a syntax as a set of formal theories, but this tutorial is meant to be an aid in constructing a language. To see how we can use this knowledge, I’m going to approach the process of constructing a language from two perspectives. The first is construction from scratch, without any preconceptions or ideas about what the grammar of the language should look like. Then I’ll look at how to take some vague ideas and how to expand them into a full language that you can expect such systems to appear in, and in the process I’ll look at how the same tools can be used to formalize an existing language.
Design a syntax from scratch is theoretically a simple process. Without any preconceptions about what certain features should look like, we can follow an orderly approach to the process. Indeed, the process is so formulaic that it might even be useful to just write out a list of things to define for the language.
Some things to keep in mind, especially in (2) and (4) is that the structures don’t have to be identical to English. Modern theories tend to attempt to describe every language with the same basic formulation, the more in common the better, but that doesn’t mean your language has to. If you want to put the subject into the VP and move the object out of the VP, sure go ahead and do so. But keep in mind that making exceedingly different rules means that your constituency tests should have equivalent forms. If you do indeed move subjects into VP and objects out, you’ll need to have a situation where you can replace the VP with a stand in, something similar to “do so”, and have it mean the same thing. It’s important to keep in mind why we say languages have the rules we’ve found for them, or developed, as the case may be.
Finding a syntax for preexisting ideas is a bit more complicated than designing one from scratch. Because we already have some “canonical” forms, we have to perform tests on them to discover how they behave. We can perhaps make a list of things to do here to identify the features of the language.
Having multiple ideas would make (3) easier to decide. For example, if we have three ideas that end up having the same head positioning, we might want to say that our language should have that positioning as the typical position. Alternatively, if the ideas have different head positioning we can choose whichever we prefer more and make that typical, while making the other one exceptional.
The rules listed above can apply just as well to a description process as well, treating the entire language as one giant idea to be analyzed. Input from less formal grammars can speed up the process of creating a formal grammar.
Binding theory is an attempt to account for certain phenomena involving pronouns and anaphors by using the structural framework we’ve developed up to this point. To understanding where this theory comes from it’s important first to understand what these kinds of words do that makes them so special and how they’re set apart from normal nouns.
Normal nouns are what’re called R-expressions (“r” for “referencing”). The have meaning derived from their reference to things outside of the words of the sentence, things in the world (e.g. “the tree”, “a car”). Pronouns, on the other hand, derive meaning by referring to other words in the sentence (to R-expressions), or from context, etc. (e.g. “he”, “her”, “they”). Finally, anaphors get their meaning only from R-expressions in the sentence (e.g. “itself”, “ourselves”).
We can find examples of special pronoun and anaphor behavior in these stunningly ungrammatical sentences:
So the question is why are these ungrammatical, and to find that out we need to determine what differences we can find between grammatical and ungrammatical examples.
The first thing to introduce is a way of indicating whether or not two phrases refer to the same entity in the world. We’ll do this by using a unique subscript letter after the word or phrase for each unique entity.
This indexing allows us to note when two phrases refer to the same entity by identifying the same subscript on each phrase. By possessing the same index, that is, by being coindexed, we can determine that they corefer to the same entity.
Secondly, a simple notion of giving meaning is required. We’ll call a phrase an antecedent if it gives meaning to another phrase.
We can now explore some examples of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences to find some initial similarities and differences.
By examining the structure we find that the anaphor himself can’t corefer with an R-expressing that’s contained within another phrase that’s in subject position. If we examine the tree diagrams below, we’ll find that in the grammatical situations, the antecedents always c-command the anaphor.
We can now define binding:
In 7-9, the sentence is grammatical only when the anaphor is bound by its antecedent. If this is general, then we should find cases where an anaphor binds its antecent to be ungrammatical.
Since these are all ungrammatical, let’s make a rule out of this.
If English were as simple as that we’d be finished with binding, but unfortunately English isn’t that simple. We can easily find examples where an anaphor is bound by its antecedent but the sentence is still ungrammatical.
In order to account for this we have to introduce the concept of a binding domain. Simply, a binding domain is the clause (TP) that contains the anaphor. What we notice about (16), now, is that the antecedent is outside of the binding domain of the anaphor. We can make a revision to Principle A to include a locality constraint (a rule that involves nearness).
For now this theory will suffice, but in the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll look at some easy-to-find examples of binding within a binding domain that still ungrammatical, and we’ll see how we can revise our theory to make it fit better.
The behavior of pronouns turns out to be the reverse of anaphors. Consider these sentences:
In (18), the pronoun is unbound (or free), but in (19) the pronoun is bound. Looking at embedded clauses we find that if the pronoun is in an embedded clause, that is, a different binding domain, then the sentence is grammatical regardless of coreference. In the grammatical cases the pronoun is free within its binding domain, and in the ungrammatical cases it’s bound. We can make a second rule from this.
The last of the set to deal with, after anaphors and pronouns, is R-expressions, the whole set of nouns and phrases that aren’t anaphors nor pronouns. At first it seems like we shouldn’t need to describe where these can go at all, given our previous rules, but we can find perfectly ungrammatical sentences that don’t break either Principle A or B.
In these situations, what we notice is that the sentence is ungrammatical only when the R-expression is bound. We can make a third rule now.
With binding we now have a fairly complete way to describe many of the behaviors of language, in terms of structure, and we can begin to look at some of the things we can do with this knowledge.
The current theory is very powerful and can account for a great many phenomena in natural languages. Despite this, it still misses an enormous number of sentences that are grammatical, at least in English, and the theory as given can’t account at all for some languages.
English was the language we used to base our current theory on, but within English there are some clear counterexamples to the theory we have. Just within noun phrases we have examples of constituency lower than NP but higher than N. For example, “the big brown dog and the little one too”. In this example “one” replaces “brown dog”, suggesting that the “brown dog” is itself a constituent, but given our existing PS rules for English this shouldn’t be possible. We thus have an anomalous constituent:
Irish is a type SO-I language, which means it has VSO word order. With the above grammar, placing the subject as the daughter of a TP makes it impossible to get it between the verb and the object. If we make new structures between V and VP, like we suggested for English, we’ll still find some example sentences that don’t word. For example, Irish has AuxSVO word order whenever an auxiliary verb is used, which makes it hard to have a single rule to account for word order.
Japanese and Latin are what are sometimes called non-configurational languages, which means that they don’t have any significant amount of word order on a clause level. Japanese, for instance, only requires that verbs appear at the end of a clause (Japanese is a type III language), and that verb complements appear immediately before the verb. Latin is often cited as an example of a language with no word order on the clause level at all. Non-configurational languages such as these would require a large number of PS rules, one for each possible word order. With large clauses this could get unwieldy very quickly.
In the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll see how modern linguistics approaches these problems, and look at some experimental ways of describing behavior that would be more useful in the conlanging process.
One of the biggest concerns of modern linguistics is to discover the fundamental principles that underly all human languages. This will be the motivation for further development of the theories we’ve covered as we’ll see in the advanced syntax tutorial. But even at the level we’re currently working on there are some trends within natural languages that we can explore, which give us insight into things ranging from how cognitive processes formulate sentences to how grammatical features develop over time.
These trends are called Linguistic Universals or Universals of Grammar, and they come in two types: mere statistical trends, and true universals (or “implicational universals”). The statistical trends are just that — trends that appear in patterning that likely come about through historical change under the influence of any number of forces such as ease of cognition. Implication universals, on the other hand, tend to be much more closely followed, and make predictive statements that say if a language has feature X, it’ll almost assuredly have feature Y as well.
There are also other ways of dividing universals, namely by the parts of a language that they affect. Phonetic/phonological universals involve the sounds and sound changes that a language goes through, morphological universals involve word structure and morphemes, etc. In this section I’ll be covering the universals that can be related to syntax, and I’ll explore possible ways that these universals can arise from syntax.
Word order typology is the classification of languages by how certain types of words are ordered relative to one another in a sentence or constituent. The most common word order typological classification is the order of subjects, objects, and verbs within a sentence. Since there are three types of words, we have six possible configurations: VSO, SVO, SOV, VOS, OVS, OSV. In surveys of natural languages, the first three, with the subject preceding the object, are overwhelmingly used as the normal declarative word order, the latter three comprising lower single digit percentages. We’ll call these two word orders SO and OS, respectively. For each of the word orders we’ll also identify them by the position of the verb, I, II, and III for verb first, second, and third, respectively. A language can then be classified by a combination of both, as SO/I, OS/III, etc. Because SO word order is so overwhelmingly common, SO word order can simply be assumed on bare verb position numbers (e.g. III would mean SO/III not OS/III, etc.).
A second way of classifying languages is by their use of prepositions or postpositions, which we can call Pr and Po, respectively. A third is the order of adjectives and nouns; if a noun comes before its adjectives we can call this N, if a noun comes after its adjectives we can call this A. Looking at the Pr/Po and A/N classifications in relation to I/II/III classification we can find some interesting trends, such as type I languages always also being Pr, type III languages usually being Po, etc. We can now make a list of possible configurations (ignoring the rare OS configurations) and look at their frequency.
Just from this bit of data, and our knowledge of syntax from before, we notice a trend that would be helpful in constructing a believable language. The common forms, I-PR-N, II-PR, and III-PO, all show, by contrast to other forms or by contrast to sub-forms, a preference for keeping consistent head positioning, i.e. languages prefer to be as consistently head-initial or head-final as possible.
Syntactic universals are more specific than the typical word order universals. They still are visible in the word order of a sentence, but they tend to be much more specialized in scope. For example, question particles in yes/no questions tend to appear after the word they mark, and they tend to appear more in type II and III languages; when they appear in type I languages the particle appears before the word they mark. Auxiliary verbs, too, show interesting syntactic patterning that follows from the generalization about consistent head positioning.
Morphosyntactic universals are in between syntactic universals and morphological universals in that they involve morphological tendencies in relationship to syntactic features. For example, what we find is that morphological items tend to behave similar to heads in PPs, in that if a language has just suffixing, then it should behave like a language with postpositions and be type III, and indeed this turns out to be the case. Indeed, if a language has just suffixes then it has postpositions, if it has just prefixes then it has prepositions.
In the case of agreement between nouns and adjectives, N languages always have agreeing adjectives. More generally, type III languages almost always have case systems. The full complexity of syntax related tendencies among languages is beyond the scope of this section, but you can read more about them here.
Some of the implications that we can derive from these universals would make a nice set of grammatical rules. For instance, the tendency for affixes to behave like adpositions might indicate some hidden structure that involves the affixes as the head of some adposition-like phrase, undergoing some sort of historical change from an adposition to an affix, thus giving us an idea of how to evolve a constructed language. The tendency for languages to try to be consistent in their head positioning could result from a historical process that changes parts of speech into one another. Alternatively, to make a truly alien feeling language, these universals could be reversed, making a Po type I language or something similar. Knowing the universals clearly makes it easier to create both a naturalist language as well as interesting alien languages.

Sentences, as we all know, are made up of words. But not all words are alike; some words represent objects, some represent actions, etc. What a word represents — its part of speech or syntactic category — plays a significant role in its behavior in a language’s syntax. We can identify two major categories of words. Lexical parts of speech convey whole meanings in themselves, and consist of categories like noun and verb. Functional parts of speech, on the other hand, show relationships between words, or provide extra meaning to words, and include categories like preposition and conjunction.
The lexical parts of speech can be divided into the four major categories of nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives (Adj), and adverbs (Adv). These categories aren’t necessarily universal, and what distinguishes them from one another is a matter of how they behave. Identifying a word as noun or verb is done by looking at what it does: a word is a noun because it behaves like a noun, etc. These particular categories are specific to English and many Indo-European languages, and because this tutorial is in English, and will focus primarily on English syntax, these are the categories that’ll be used.
The typical way of describing what nouns are, in informal or grade school English grammar, is “person, place, or thing”. Nouns can also be emotions, colors, abstract concepts, etc. Nouns can often have quantity, specificity, properties as shown by adjectives, roles in an action, etc.
Verbs are usually actions, involving some change, or states of being, involving one manner of being vs. another. They often can be described as having tense (when it occurred), aspect (how it occurred through time), manner as shown by adverbs, participants as shown by nouns and other phrases, etc.
Adjectives describe qualities of nouns. They can represent colors, shapes, or more abstract qualities like true, honest, or absurd. Adjectives themselves can have quality or manner, described by adverbs.
Adverbs describe qualities of non-nouns, i.e. verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They’re perhaps the most abstract of the lexical categories. For example, quickly is an adverb that describes the speed of a verb, but there’s no quality of quickness in an action that can be measured, it’s a very abstract and relative notion compared to a quality such as red. Adverbs like very are even more abstract.
Functional categories are even harder to conceptualize than the most abstract adverbs. They convey things like tense, ability, permission, and aspect of verbs, relationships between phrases, specificity of nouns, etc. Some common functional categories in English are prepositions (P), determiners (D), conjunctions (Conj), complementizers (C), tenses (T), and negation (Neg).
Features are abstract semantic properties that can be used to describe words. Some, such as purality, are not as abstract as others, such as modality. They tend to be extra information about a word that’s relevant to the structure of the sentence, governing the relationship between the word and other words around it. Features are generally written between brackets. Having a feature is indicated by prepended “+” to the feature, lacking it is indicated by prepending “–”. Multiple features are separated by commas.
Some examples of features:
In the advanced tutorial we’ll see how features themselves can be indicated lexically, and how features can exist in certain places and affect the behavior of words in a sentence to convey certain meanings.
In looking at how various types of words behave, we find that they end up dividing into various classes that govern how they can be placed in a sentence. In some languages these subcategories can be overtly marked on the words (Spanish, for instance, has overtly marked gender subcategories, which governs verb agreement), while in others the subcategories are covert and don’t show any markings of the subcategory they belong to.
In English, nouns can be divided into two categories, count nouns, which represent individual countable items, and mass nouns, which represent uncountable things or substances. Count nouns require an indication of number, while mass nouns don’t:
Count nouns can also be used only with certain quantifiers, while mass nouns certain others:
If we want to label these nouns for subcategory, we can do so with features. For instance, the distinction between count and mass nouns can be marked with the feature [±count]:
We can also look at some subcategories of verbs in English. By examining the number of arguments a verb takes, and where they’re positioned in the sentence, we can find some useful properties of verbs.
Just by looking at the number of arguments a verb takes (its valency) we find three kinds of verbs in English. Intransitive verbs take only one argument, the subject, transitive verbs take two arguments, the subject and the direct object, and ditransitive verbs take three arguments, the subject, the direct object, and the indirect object. Some verbs seem to have optional transitivity, such as the verb “drive”: You can say “I drive.” but you can also say “I drive a car.”. In these situations we can say that there are actually two verbs with different valency.
Verbs can also require certain things in certain places relative to them in the sentence. Intransitive verbs require their argument before them. We can indicate this with a feature such as [NP __], with the underscore representing the position of the verb and with NP representing a Noun Phrase. Transitive verbs require an argument before them and after them, and this can be indicated by the feature [NP __ NP] or [NP __ {NP/CP}] (CP for Complement Phrase). The curly braces enclose alternate options, separated by slashes. We say that the object of some transitive verbs can be either an NP or a CP because we have examples like “I said nothing.”, as well as “I said that the pie was tasty.”. Ditransitive verbs can be described with yet another feature.
Here’s an example table of English verb subcategories, with their matching features, and with examples:
Trees structures, as previously mentioned, have distinct components, the nodes, that contain or are contained by other nodes. This hierarchy of containment, and co-contained-ness, allows us to identify certain relationships between nodes that are useful in describing why things behave the way they behave in a language.
Starting with some simple PS rules
we can generate a tree
We can now explore the different parts of trees. A, B, ... are examples of nodes. Nodes are connected to one another by lines, which differentiate branches. B, and the nodes below it, form a branch distinct from C and the nodes below C. D is a distinct branch from E, and so on. If a node has only one branch below it, it’s said to be non-branching; if it has more than one branch below it, it’s branching.
At the top of the tree we find A, which is not below any other node. Such nodes are root nodes. At the bottom we find D, E, H, and G, which have no nodes below them. Such nodes are terminal nodes (sometimes called leaf nodes). The nodes A, B, C, and F, all have nodes below them, and are called non-terminal nodes. The actual letters given to the nodes are called labels.
Terminal nodes are almost always heads (in the advanced syntax tutorial we’ll say that all terminal nodes are also heads), and all non-terminal nodes are phrases.
The simplest kind of structural relationship between nodes is a dominance relationship. A node dominates another node if it’s above that node in the tree. In the example tree, A dominates all other nodes, B dominates D and E, C dominates F, H, and G, and F dominates H.
We can also make statements about which collections of terminal nodes are dominated by which other nodes. For instance, the set {D, E} is dominated by both B and A. With B, the set is the same as the set of nodes dominated by B, but with A, the set is only some of the nodes dominated by A. We can say then that B exhaustively dominates the set, but A doesn’t.
We can also notice relationships between how far nodes are from one another in a dominance relationship. Some nodes, such as F, are directly above other nodes, in this case H, while other dominating nodes, such as A, are not directly above. When a node is directly above another node, it immediately dominates that node.
A node that immediately dominates another node is called the mother of that other node. A node that is immediately dominated by another node is called the daughter of that other node. Daughters of the same node are called sisters.
Another simple relationship that can be described in terms of domination is constituency.
Precedence is not as simple as dominance, but still quite simple. A node precedes another node if it appears before that node. But there are two distinct kinds of precedence, and one kind depends on the other.
Immediacy of precedence can play an important role in the analysis of things like direct vs. indirect objects. Immediacy in precedence is similar to immediacy in dominance, so the definition will be similar.
C-command is probably the most useful structural relationship when it comes to building a theory for how a language works syntactically. A c-command relationship should be easy to grasp if you understand dominance and sister-hood. Basically, a node c-commands another node if it’s sister to that node or sister to a node that dominates that node.
You can find c-commanded nodes visually by following a simple rule: Go up one then down one or more, and any node you land at will be c-commanded by the node you started at.
C-command relationships can show symmetry, as well. Symmetry can play an important role in the behavior of certain constituents. Symmetric c-command is essentially a sister relationship. Asymmetric c-command is essentially all other c-commanding situations.
Government is another important relationship. It’s built on top of c-command and so it’s easy to define in those terms. It looks very similar to immediacy relationships.
Some government relationships only apply between heads or between phrases. We can define two sub-types of governance based on the types of the participating nodes.
The last kind of relationship is the grammatical relationships. These aren’t structural relationships at all, but rather semantic relationships that tend to end up taking on the same structural form in language after language. Some of these will be revised in the advanced syntax tutorial.
These relationships depend entirely on the PS rules of a language, in this case English.
English has type of object called an Indirect Object (IO). Indirect objects can sometimes appear as a normal Object or sometimes as the Object of a Preposition.
Now that we have two kinds of objects that both can be NP daughters of VPs, we need to redefine the term Direct Object, and also define an Indirect Object.
There’s another kind of object, the Oblique Object, which is usually marked with a preposition, as in:
Oblique Objects can show up in the same positions as Indirect Objects, and sometimes in the position of a Direct Object. What makes an Oblique Object distinguishable from other kinds of objects is whether or not it shows up in the argument feature for the verb. For instance, the verb “eat” has the argument feature [NP __ NP]. If a PP, such as “with jam”, shows up in the sentence, it must be an oblique object, since it’s not indicated in the argument feature.
Although there are no natlangs known to lack the noun-verb distinction, it is still a theoretical possibility for a language to lack such a distinction, as shown by the language Kēlen, which lacks verbs and replaces them with four "relationals" which function in a similar manner to adpositions.
Another possible method of destroying the distinction would be to create a verb class similar to the present participle that would be able to act as a modifier to another verb, essentially creating a long chain of complicated verbs referencing a noun without said noun actually appearing. The noun would instead be substituted by a verb participle as the patient/actor. One consequence of this would be that the language would also lack adjectives, them having been completely replaced by adverbs. Here is one possible example:
This, however, only blurs the boundary slightly, as it can be argued that the new adverbs are simply an eccentric class of nouns.
A few conlangers have attempted to build a language with only one part of speech.
In particular, the AllNoun project developed a grammar composed entirely of nouns (plus 4 punctuation symbols, which is fewer than the number of punctuation symbols in most languages).
Other conlangers have attempted to eliminate all nouns.
One approach is to replace nouns with a series of adjectives that modify a pronoun, similar to the way Toki Pona expresses the noun "soldier"
with "jan utala" (literally "fighting person") from jan (person) utala (fight) or the proper noun "Lisa" with "jan Lisa" (literally "Lisa person").
Here's a copy of a key paper by Joseph Greenberg: .
There are many theories that say that a language is simply a product of the culture that speaks it, the same way it's art and food are, so there's no reason to say that yours isn't. However, some linguistic theories claim that language is not influenced much by culture at all.
A few natlangs do seem to be influenced by culture; Japanese is the most famous example. The Japanese have throughout history been very hierarchy-conscious. Their verbs inflect to show deference between speaker and listener. Feel free to use your own judgement in how your language and culture interact.
As the undisputedly widest-spoken conlang in the world, Esperanto becomes a key point of argument for discussing conlangs in general. Critics of Esperanto have discussed whether or not Esperanto helps or hinders other languages, and it is often feared that if Esperanto was more widely-spoken, people would cease to speak their own languages, resulting in a massive number of languages going extinct. Esperantists have argued many times that Esperanto, as Zamenhof designed it, has not replaced any languages but rather supplemented them as a second language, and they point out that they are one of the few linguistic communities in the world to have virtually all members being multilingual. 
Another question, however, was whether or not Esperanto has a culture or not, and the Esperantists themselves are split on this. Raumism is a political ideology in the Esperanto community which holds that Esperanto, rather than being a neutral language purely for second-language communication between peoples, has evolved its own culture and community in its own rights. Traditional Esperantists continue to argue that Esperanto has only created an interculture, a cultural bridge between different pre-existing cultures, and that Esperanto music and literature are only parts of this rather than being distinct cultural entities in their own rights. At the same time, all Esperantists argue against general critics of Esperanto, who argue that Esperanto lacks a culture and is therefore "not useful"; the traditional Esperantist response is that Esperanto culture exists only as an element of a far larger international culture, while Raumists argue that Esperanto has its own unique culture.
The closest analogy that can be found to a constructed language is a language which has been or is being revived. The best example of this by far is Hebrew, which is the only language to have been revived from being unspoken and used only for Jewish liturgy to being the everyday first language of millions of speakers. As more Jews arrived in Mandatory Palestine, dropping the languages they spoke in the diaspora like Yiddish and Judeo-Spanish became a more popular trend to "negate the diaspora", an attempt to erase the time the Jews had been living outside of the land - the phrase "Hebrew [man], speak Hebrew" was common as the politico-cultural connotations of speaking the historical Jewish language conflicted with the "foreign" languages spoken by the Jews when they arrived.
However, much like a language created a priori, Hebrew managed to pick up elements of the other languages of its revivalists. Ghil'ad Zuckermann, a professor of revival linguistics, described the Founder Theory, arguing that a language that is revived will always be reconstructed with inescapable elements of the revivalists' mother languages. According to his theory, Hebrew formed as a hybrid with elements of both Semitic Biblical Hebrew and Indo-European Yiddish, the native language of the early revivalists. This theory equally applies to both reviving "and" constructing languages: that no matter how careful one is, elements of the language creator's culture will always be present in a conlang in one way or another.
This section covers advanced topics in phonetics (sounds) and phonology (systems of sounds).
The parts of this section are:
An alien phonology is a system of sounds — and perhaps other, non-vocal signals — for a language designed to be used by beings that are not human. It is designed to take advantage of a non-human anatomy, and will often use mechanisms of sound/signal production that would be convenient for the beings the language is made for, but are either inconvenient or impossible for humans.
An alien phonology would contain any phoneme (sound that is seen as being different form the other sounds) that would be easy for the alien to use.
It's not too hard to imagine one, without even leaving Earth.
Any and all methods of noise production and such can be used as phonemic signals, just because red is not phonemic to humans does not mean it isn't for octopi. Just because the smell of sulfur doesn't make an English word an adverb, doesn't mean it can't for an alien.
Alien language should be built around alien anatomy, I suggest that you figure out how they look, how would they make their sounds? what would be the most effective method of communication in their environment, would sound be used at all? 
How do they think, who says they use verbs and nouns? I once read an article about a language that was so context-dependent that there was a play that was simply the same word ~6,000 times, with no rhythm or stress changes, but the fact that each word had been preceded by the same word changed its meaning.
Throw away traditional thinking when you work with aliens, they are after all, alien.
When you're working with aliens, anything goes.
This section gives technical details that weren't covered in the Intermediate section, about sounds that "were" covered.
Gemination is the lengthening or shortening of vowels. This means that they are pronounced for longer. This can be applied to any vowel.
Consonant gemination is a distinction made by some languages (for example Italian and Classical Arabic) where a single consonant is distinguished from a double "geminate" consonant. They mostly occur in intervocalic position (Swedish is unusual for its final geminates). Most languages only allow some of their consonants to be geminated.
Diphthongs are complex sequences of vowels which are made of two vowels pronounced next to each other. They are contrasted from "flat" vowels in many languages. They are made of an on-glide or an off-glide vowel as well as an obligatory nucleus whereas a "flat" "pure" vowel would only be made of a nucleus. Most common on-glides/off-glides are the vowels [i] (realized as [j] when it's a glide) and [u] (realized as [w] when it's a glide).
Occasionally, some languages features triphthongs made of both an on-glide and an off-glide (examples: [jaj] or [jew]).
They must not be distinguished from hiati which are sequence of vowels separated by a syllable break (example: [ej] would be a diphthong whereas [e.i] would be a hiatus, French distinguishes  [pej] "pay" from  [pe.i] "country").
Suprasegmentals are distinctions that apply not to one phoneme but to a whole syllable or word.
Notable suprasegmental features are:
-stress (applies to a specific syllable of a whole word)
-intonation (Few languages make complex intonation distinction however some languages make simple intonation distinction such as Spanish and French which use it to distinguish statements from questions)
-juncture (where a syllable break occurs, often distinguishes multiple words from one, example in English are [a.nejm] and  [an.ejm])
-tone
-vowel and consonant harmony, the latter being relatively rare (a separation in group of different phonemes and the exclusive use of one of those group to form a word, for more information see the section "Vowel Harmony" below)
-mora (the use of distinctive syllable's weight which determines stress, timing)
This feature is common in agglutinative languages, i.e. in languages where one suffix represents one property (Turkic, Mongolian, Finnish, Hungarian). All vowels are divided in two groups (back vowels and front vowels), and only vowels from one group can be used in the word; therefore all suffices have two forms.
For example, in Tatar language the groups are following:
Plural suffix has forms lar and lär. The word for "friend" is dus, so "friends" is duslar; the word for "house" is öy, therefore, "houses" is öylär.
Sometimes there are neutral vowels that belong to both groups, like i and e in Finnish:
Usually group is selected by the kind of vowels in the root of the word. But in Chukchi language, for example, there are dominant and recessive group, and all vowels from recessive group are replaced with their dominant counterparts when a suffix with a dominant vowel is used.
Radicals are sounds produced in the back of the throat. They are divided into two categories: pharyngeals and epiglottals. Pharyngeals/epiglottals are commonly found in North Africa/Middle East (Arabic and related languages) and in British Columbia, in the Salishan languages. Pharyngeal plosives are thought to be impossible. Very few languages contrast epiglottal and pharyngeal consonants.
The pharyngeals possible are the voiceless pharyngeal fricative and the voiced pharyngeal fricative, actually an approximant. The epiglottals possible are the epiglottal plosive, the voiceless epiglottal fricative, the voiced epiglottal fricative, actually an approximant, the epiglottal trill, and the epiglottal flap, which is not known to occur in any language.
An ingressive airstream is what is generated when, instead of air flowing out, air flows in. In an mixed airstream consonant, air is pushed both in and out of the mouth, by two different methods. Ingressive consonants can be either voiced or voiceless. There are three types of ingressive consonants: Pulmonic ingressive, glottalic ingressive and clicks. Mixed airstreams are found in implosive consonants and some clicks.
In order of commoness, they are ejectives, implosives, and clicks and glottal ingressives. Pulmonic ingressives are not known to be phonemic in any language.
There are a large number of ejective consonants. The most common is k'. They are considered glottalic egressives, where the airflow is caused by the glottis moving upward rapidly, causing pressure in the oral cavity to increase rapidly. They are slightly more common than implosive consonants according to WALS, occuring in 95 languages, out of the 576 languages listed. It is sometimes postulated to exist in PIE, but such theories are usually discredited. All ejectives are unvoiced and oral (not nasal nor glottal). They are represented with an apostrophe after the letter in question. Semivowel and trill ejectives are postulated to exist, but are not found in languages, presumably because of the difficulty in pronouncing such ejectives. All unvoiced oral obstruents can be ejectives, but bilabial ejectives are rare. If a sound is not in the voiceless inventory of a language, it is unlikely that it will have the corresponding ejective.
The implosive consonants are as follows. They are found in 76 out of 576 languages listed according to WALS. They are mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Most "pulmonic" stops are lightly imploded. They are made of 
Although affricate implosives are theoretically possible, they are not found, presumably due to the difficulty in pronouncing and distinguishing it.
Glottalic ingressive consonants are articulated similarly, except that they are voiceless. They are significantly rarer than implosive consonants. They are usually shown as an implosive consonant with a voiceless diacritic. Occasionally they are shown with a upward left hook and the corresponding voiceless consonant like ƙ (which in some dialects, is also the glug-glug onomatopoeia). These are extremely rare
Lingual ingressives, or clicks, are the next most common, centered around the Khoisan languages in Africa. Khoisan is not a genetic family, but a wastebasket taxon with most click languages of Africa. Clicks can be articulated in a variety of ways. They can be nasalized and can be pulmonically voiced, unvoiced, or a whole litany of contours. Clicks come in several main POAs, bilabial, dental, alveolar, retroflex, and palatal. In addition there is a percussive click, pronounced by the tongue smacking the bottom of the mouth. The percussive click only occurs in a cluster with alveolars in the only language where it is attested, the Sandawe language.
Click consonants are famous to the Western world mainly because of the 1980s movie, "The Gods Must Be Crazy", in which the main character is a member of a tribe that communicates only in clicks. No language has been found that communicates in only clicks, however.
CXS, or Conlang X-SAMPA, is an encoding of the International Phonetic Alphabet into 7-bit ASCII. CXS is a slightly modifed form of X-SAMPA, an encoding proposed in 1995 by a British phonetician, John C. Wells; the modifications have been devised by and for the members of the CONLANG mailing list — whose name gave rise to the word "conlang" used in this book, and thus indirectly to all the other uses of prefix "con-" in the Conworld series of wikibooks.

A design priority for the CXS encoding is to give the shortest names to the most commonly encoded sounds — which means that the most unusual sounds, most likely not to have sound files available here, are also most likely to have longer names.
In the table of pulmonic consonants, for each place and manner of articulation (column and row), there may be an unvoiced consonant and a voiced consonant. Unvoiced consonants appear on the left side of that cell in the table, voiced consonants on the right.
Alternative notation ' can be used for ' (the labiodental approximant).
The joining of the two sounds in an affricate or double articulation can be notated explicitly by following the second with a right paren, as in //.
At each point in the chart, the vowel to the left of the "•" is unrounded, the vowel to the right is rounded. The symbols for the mid central and near-open central vowels do not distinguish between rounded and unrounded forms.
A diacritic is a modifier added to a sound symbol to either alter or more specifically describe the sound. In CXS, all diacritics are suffixes after the symbol. All but four of the CXS diacritics are sequences of two or more characters starting with underscore (the other four being the single-character diacritics ' ' ' and ').
A suprasegmental is a symbol that describes a feature of language sound above the level of consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, or stress.
Some conlangers use ' for palatalization instead of '.
Some conlangers use ' for primary stress and ' for secondary stress, instead of ' and '.
Here are tables of detailed data on CXS symbols and other notations, arranged alphabetically by CXS coding. The tables include translations of each notation to IPA; descriptions of the notations' meanings, with links to associated Wikipedia articles; and examples of words using the notations.
For high-level explanations, and charts arranged by how the sounds are pronounced, see the next section.
These sequences represent sounds. All CXS sequences starting with a letter or digit are here.
These notations represent diacritics and other information (suprasegmentals). They are ordered by "primary character" — which is often the first character in the sequence, but is the second character if the sequence begins with an underscore (such as ) or is an angle-bracketed letter (such as ). Letters are listed first, then digits, then non-alphanumerics.
IPA symbols that are ordinary lower-case letters are the same in CXS as in the IPA, and vice versa. 
CXS uses a following backslash as an escape character to create a new symbol. Often the new symbol is similar to the old in some way or other, as with the velar nasal ' and uvular nasal ', but sometimes they have nothing to do with each other, as with the open-mid back rounded vowel ' versus the bilabial click '.
IPA consonant symbols that are ordinary (small) upper-case letters are named in CXS by adding a backslash to the IPA symbol. IPA vowel symbols of this type (ordinary upper-case letters) are the same in CXS as in the IPA (no backslash added).
Alternative notation ' can be used for ' (the labiodental approximant).
The joining of the two sounds in an affricate or double articulation can be notated explicitly by following the second with a right paren, as in //.
At each point in the chart, the vowel to the left of the "•" is unrounded, the vowel to the right is rounded. The symbols for the mid central and near-open central vowels do not distinguish between rounded and unrounded forms.
Some conlangers use ' for palatalization instead of '.
Some conlangers use ' for primary stress and ' for secondary stress, instead of ' and '.
Entries should be succinct, lucid, and preferably provide big-picture insights.
Here are some basic conlanging and linguistics terms.
Terminology often works best within a limited framework; succinctly explaining when it "doesn't" work so well is big-picture insight that may be difficult to obtain from enthusiastic, or simplified, explanations within its favored framework.
If a term could be listed either in adjective or noun form (as "inflectional" or "inflection"), prefer whichever feels more natural and provides smoothest coverage. An adjectival entry should list definitions for the various kinds of nouns it can modify; but if the adjectival form has a generic sense and then specifics to be mentioned for some nouns and not others, it may work better to list the noun form and then list specific adjective-noun combinations.
If a term doesn't list any sections of the book where it is discussed, although it "could" be something that doesn't need coverage in the book proper, or something that is covered but not yet linked from here, it could also signal a topic waiting for coverage.
List conlang-related people, organizations, discussion fora, and books (or other works) here. Languages belong in a separate section, below. Most people of interest are likely to be conlangers of note; presumably if a conlang is suitable to list below, so is its creator here. Books "about conlanging" are especially likely to be relevant; we probably don't want to try to list every work that uses a conlang, as the list could get unmanageably long. If you think you or your work/forum/whatever should be listed, it's probably best to ask on the talk page for someone else to make that call and, if yes, write the entry.
Languages of interest for conlangers, with explanations of why they are of interest. Many are conlangs, but some natlangs are also listed too.
These should be languages that have gotten some attention in the conlanging community; don't list your own conlangs here (unless it's gained some fame/notoriety in the conlanging community). Any conlang that has a or an ISO code presumably qualifies.
This list is an opportunity to explain how each language fits into the big-picture perspective of conlanging; this high-level view is often difficult to deduce by studying detailed resources about each language (to which this list will usually provide an outgoing link).
                       
These lemmas, sets of inflected words (e.g. be, is, am, are...) make up 50% of English text.

The Beginner level of this book is designed to allow students with no prior knowledge of conlanging or linguistics to readily create their own language that isn't a relex of English (nor of any other existing language). It introduces you to the fundamentals of constructing languages, and aims to keep technical terminology to a bare minimum.
Each section is designed to cover the basic principles of a different aspect of languages, both natural and constructed. The sections are:
Think about "why" your conlang is used. The context in which your language is used can make the meaning it communicates different from the meaning encoded in its words and grammar. For example, in English, if your friend tells you "Bob has lost his marbles", depending on the situation your friend "probably" doesn't mean that Bob has misplaced a number of small glass balls — though if you had just suggested that the three of you play a game of marbles, it's possible your friend is after all talking about the equipment needed for the game. The ways that meaning depends on context are partly cultural; so by thinking about these things, you can avoid accidentally imposing your own culture on the language you create.
There are lots of complex ways context can affect the meaning of language; but some fairly simple techniques can get you well started. Some ideas:
While we are all familiar with English grammar (if you can read this), it should be noted that every language has its own grammar that may not resemble that of other languages very closely at all. Even closely related languages may differ greatly in their grammar. Don't be tempted to just copy English grammar for your conlang — the result would only be a relex of English.
Unrelated languages may have grammars that seem to have nothing in common. The use of triggers or polysynthesis would strike many English speakers as quite alien. Japanese honorifics likely appear counterrevolutionary to socialists or at least unnecessary to the average English speaker. Nonetheless, they illustrate the massive variety in grammar.
There are two main parts of grammar:
The difference between the present and past tense forms "run" and "ran" in English is an example of morphology. The difference between the sentences "The dog bit the man" and "The man bit the dog" is an example of syntax.
A word can take different forms to show that the word has different properties, like singular/plural, or past/present/future. Sometimes a property of a word can only be one way, like "she" that's always feminine (though this doesn't happen too much in English). When properties of a word can change, the changes are shown by adding affixes; some different kinds of affixes were suggested in the previous section. Different properties may be shown by separate affixes, but they don't have to be; it's common in natlangs for a single affix to show a certain combination of properties, like "past second-person plural", or "masculine accusative singular".
Here are some properties of words that you might choose to show in your morphology.
In verbs, morphology often shows tense, mood, aspect, and voice, and sometimes person, number, and evidentiality.
In nouns, morphology may show case, gender, and number.
Adjectives and adverbs can come in regular form/more/most (often called "degrees" or "degrees of comparison"), and may also agree with properties of what they modify (like gender and number).
The three main parts of a sentence are the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O). Every natural language on Earth (okay, "almost" every language on Earth) has a "neutral" word order in which these bits of information can be conveyed without added information or special emphasis. The default, unmarked word order of English is SVO. ("Mice eat cheese.") Spanish uses SVO much of the time, but typically uses SOV when the object is a pronoun ("Mice it eat"). Theoretically any order can be used, but some are more common than others. SVO languages make up about 40% of the world's natural languages; SOV are another 40%, and VSO ("Eat mice cheese") about 15%. The other three combinations, OSV, VOS, and OVS, are much rarer among natural human languages, for some reason, but that doesn't keep you from using them in a conlang. Klingon is OVS. uses OSV — and apparently so does 's native language, judging from the odd way he arranges his sentences in English ("Your father he is").
Just because a language has a neutral order of these parts, that doesn't mean it always uses that order. In English, some kinds of questions use a different order, as in "Are you serious?" (VSO), or "What do you mean?" (mainly OSV, with an extra twist in the auxiliary verb "do"). The conlang uses word order to show tense: SOV for past, SVO for present, and VSO for future.
The next most important thing to decide about word order is whether modifiers — be they words, phrases, or clauses — come before or after the word they modify. For example, an adjective in English usually comes before its noun, so "red brick" is a building material with a certain color, rather than a color typical of that building material (which in English is called "brick red"); but in Spanish, an adjective usually comes "after" its noun, so "rojo ladrillo" — word by word, literally "red brick" — is a brick-like shade of red.
There are a few VSO and SOV languages that don't always follow these rules, positioning some kinds of modifiers differently. And anyway, since you're building a conlang, you get to put things where "you" want them.
Modifying phrases and clauses are usually marked by special words: English uses a "preposition" at the start of a modifying phrase, while other languages may use a "postposition" at the end of the phrase, and still others bound both sides of the phrase with a "circumposition". Usually, there's a marking word between the phrase and what it modifies — so that a preposition goes on a phrase after what it modifies (as in English), and a postposition goes on a phrase before what it modifies.
Languages can differ in how much they rely on morphology versus syntax, and how they specifically use each of these two aspects of grammar to convey meaning. Some languages rely heavily on changes within words to indicate meaning, and let words be arranged somewhat freely within sentences, like Latin: the neutral word order in Latin is SOV, but these main parts of the sentence are marked by their form, so that rearranging their order only changes which parts are most emphasized. Other languages rely heavily on the order of words within sentences, like English.
A final thought on grammatical ambiguity. In natural languages, ambiguity happens. It happens because a sentence can be read in two different ways, and it happens because one language doesn't even try to specify something that another language goes to a lot of trouble to pin down. Some languages don't even (grammatically) show past, present, and future tense! So an ambiguity in your grammar isn't "always" a problem — your conspeakers might have some rule for resolving it, or avoiding it, or they might not even notice it.
If you're creating a language then there's a good chance that you'll want to learn to speak it with relative fluency once it's complete. In general, the keys to learning to speak your conlang are the same as when you're trying to learn a natural language. We'll take you through some simple techniques in this section.
A good way to learn any language is to use example sentences that show the grammar you're learning, in addition to a list of words and explanation of the grammar. You can review these sentences — hopefully a sequence of sentences that gradually increase in complexity and build on one another in the vocabulary used — over and over again until you are reading them directly in the language rather than mentally translating each one as you read it.
So, a good way to learn your conlang is to create such example sentences in your own conlang, and then review them regularly. This can be quite easy or rather a pain in the glutes, depending on the type of language. If your conlang barely morphs its words, this task will probably be quite straightforward. If your conlang morphs words for every minute difference in meaning, especially if your native language does not, this will be a painstaking task, though still useful in the end.
Here we want to give you some tips on how to create the example sentences, and point you to some sources for test sentences to translate which may challenge you and make sure you have covered all the grammatical and semantic bases.
Example sentences are a good way to learn a language, but then again, you have to use even more techniques. These techniques include ways that language learners typically use to memorize words and phrases, and match them against the ones in their own language. There are a few ways to do this:
Probably the best and most effective way to memorize any word or phrase. For example, if you wanted to learn what the word "dog" meant, and remember what it is, you might link it to a picture, or a key word from your native language. Another good idea (if your conlang is somewhat regular) would be to include on the flashcard the grammar needed to form that word or phrase. For example, "the cat jumps over the dog, article + noun + verb (conjugated) + article + noun". This is an easy way to do things, because you can include as many facets of grammar as you want, if you happen to have different cases, more complex conjugations, etc.
If you have a sound-recording device, write down a few simple sentences in your conlang and then speak them aloud. Once they're recorded, you can load these sentences into your mp3 player and have samples of your conlang on the go.
In the beginning, you can offer glosses after each sentence in order to remind yourself of what's being said. As you progress, however, try to leave these glosses out.
A fun project to try is to write a short story in your conlang. Stories like and portions of the are short enough to be do-able, but long enough and complex enough to be a real challenge.
If you're going to teach a language to yourself, why not get some others involved too? It is a lot easier to learn when you are immersed into the language, and if other people speak it too, your language skills will improve. Also, teaching the language helps internalize it in the teacher, because they have to know the information in order to teach it. Devise a curriculum guide, verb charts, vocabulary charts, flashcard, worksheets, or anything else that might be required to learn your language in the classroom. Who knows, somebody might come along one day and decide to learn it for themselves.
It is easier to learn a language with a partner than alone. To that end some conlangers have formed partnerships to use and learn each other's languages by, e.g., email correspondence.
To become fluent in a language you must use it regularly. Once you have worked out enough of the basic phonology and grammar, it is a good idea to write at least one new sentence in your language every day (more on some days than others, probably), coining some new words as necessary, and also re-read some sentences you've previously written in the language every day. Once you've familiarized yourself with the basics using example sentences, it is a good idea to start doing some more extensive writing in the language, perhaps not every day, but one or more times per week; for instance, keeping a journal in the language, and sometimes re-reading your old journal entries. Or you can respond to the various translation challenges that are regularly posted in places like the CONLANG mailing list and the Zompist Bulletin Board.
Spoken language is much older than written language. Many beginning conlangers try to build their first languages out of written words without paying too much attention to what they will sound like, but this approach, while usable, is really the wrong way 'round. Before any written language existed, all the rules that govern how languages work — the rules of grammar — were already in place; what they determined was how language was built from patterns of sound.
The first step is to decide on what sounds to use in your language. No languages use precisely the same set of sounds; for example, the sound "th" in English does not occur in most other languages (although it does in some, such as Swahili, Greek, and European Spanish); conversely, many languages contain sounds that English does not use at all.
You probably already know that sounds are classed as "consonants" and "vowels". In deciding on what sounds to use in your language, it often helps to consider these two categories separately. A chart of consonant and vowel sounds is available in the appendix . For now, don't worry about the symbols used; just enjoy hearing some of the exotic sounds you might want to add to your language! But don't get too exotic; make sure that you can pronounce all the sounds you're going to use, and that you can tell them apart easily. (There will be plenty of time for building conlangs that you can't pronounce yourself "after" you've built ones you can — like a juggler practicing with eyes open before trying it blindfolded!) Another guideline is: don't add more sounds than you will actually need. If you want to use lots of non-English sounds, maybe think about deleting some sounds that English does use as well.
But regardless of what sounds you ultimately decide to use or not use, remember that it is important not to throw in every sound you come across; limit yourself to a system of sounds, rather than every sound that exists. If you find yourself with 50 sounds without a good reason why, you have probably gone overboard. The sounds should also be similar to one another in some way; avoid having "freak" sounds that have no relatives. For example, if you have an aspirated stop (a hard consonant like "t", with a puff of air after it), try to have more than one (but not "every" aspirated stop).
Choose a convenient way to spell out the sounds you've chosen, so that you can easily write about them, and be sure to write down a clear explanation of just what your spelling rules are. It's a good idea to imitate standard descriptions of your sounds, rather than devising your own; that's the best way to be sure it's clear — even to you, some time later — just what sounds you intended. In the Intermediate level of this wikibook, we'll cover the computer-friendly notation CXS (short for Conlang X-SAMPA), and its big brother IPA (the International Phonetic Alphabet), which are ways to spell out sounds without depending on the spelling rules of any particular language.
When you have your sounds, you will have to work on ways of putting them together. Languages differ greatly in this respect: for example, English usually requires every syllable to contain a vowel; even words with no vowel written, such as the mathematical term "nth", are pronounced with one — "enth". Not all languages follow this rule; some, on the other hand, require every syllable to "end" with a vowel. If you are going to allow consonants to come after vowels at the end of syllables, you might only allow one consonant, or you might allow a cluster (as English does). Some sounds might be prohibited from certain positions; for instance, the "ng" sound in English can never begin a word, but in Tagalog it can. English allows many clusters of consonants, but prohibits many others: a word may begin "str", but not "zdr". You can make your own decisions on what clusters to allow; Russian and Polish, for example, have no problem with clusters like "zdr".
The types of sound used in a language (especially a themed language, such as Elvish) depends on the theme itself. For example, an Elvish language would be very liquid-heavy with many approximants while Orcish would have fewer gliding sounds and more gruff chokes. Keep in mind that there are two kinds of sounds: voiced and unvoiced. Feel free to pick and choose, but remember that if your people can make a voiceless sound, they can most likely make a voiced one.
Okay, you've decided on some sounds that you want to use in your language, on a way to write the sounds, and on what sounds can go where; now it's time to start word-building.
Word building isn't as simple as picking a word from the dictionary and making up a pattern of sounds (don't worry, it's not as boring either). If you look in an English dictionary you will find many words that can be broken up into smaller words. For example, the word everybody can be split into the two words every and body. Even more often, you will find words that can be broken up into pieces that aren't actually full words. Indescribable can be broken down into in-, describe, and -able. You will notice that "in-" and "-able", while not full words, still mean something (even if what they mean isn't exactly clear); the same word-parts appear in inadequate and readable and many other words.
These 'half words' are called affixes, and they build new words from simpler words or based on stems which do not stand alone (like in Latin, stems are a part of words, like "cor-"). (There are also affixes that change properties of a word without changing what word it is, like English "-s" for plural. The inflection, like plural "s", can be applied using affixes, but we'll deal with those in the next section.) You'll almost certainly want some word-building affixes for your conlang. They give your vocabulary texture, and the more of them you have, the more words you can add to your vocabulary just by inventing one new simple word.
There are lots of different kinds of affixes, depending on how they change a word when they attach to it. Some simple techniques you can use:
An affix may take different forms on different words, like "-able" that on some words becomes "-ible". Sometimes the forms used on different words are so different that you might think of them as different affixes, that just happen to mean the same thing and apply to entirely different sets of words — like the plural affix in goose → geese, where for most English words the plural affix has the form "-s" or "-es". 
If you set up your word-building affixes to work the same way as in English, even if they use different sounds and attach differently, they'll still make your conlang feel similar to English. For example, if you have an affix equivalent to English "un-", don't use it exactly the way English does. Experiment with it — you might have no word for "bad", but have "ungood" instead; maybe have a word for "uncommon" that doesn't use the "un-", in the same way "bad" isn't "ungood".
The English word manual comes from the Latin word "manus", which means "hand". Right? Well, sort of. Latin is a language with relatively few different words, so each word has to do a lot of work. The Latin word "manus" does mean "hand", the part of the human anatomy; but it also means "fist"; "handwriting"; "finishing touch"; "workmanship"; "team"; "gang"; "band of soldiers"; and "trunk", the part of the anatomy of an elephant. The English language has a tremendous number of different words, so the average word doesn't have to do nearly as much — but especially basic and common words may still have a fairly wide range of meanings, and the English word hand is like that; it can mean everything from a person's handwriting (like in Latin), or the pointy bits on a clock face, to the set of cards that a player holds in a card game. (Compare: Latin manus, English hand.)
No word in one natlang means exactly the same thing as any word in another natlang. To keep your conlang from feeling like English, don't give it words for just the same concepts as in English. Try to invent words that have the meanings of more than one English word, or are more specific than English words. Even better are words that fall between levels of description in English. For example, you might create a word that means "a four-legged hairy animal", to cover dog as well as horse, but not as much as mammal or animal. Think about a whole set of related or similar things (for instance, colors, animals, or family relationships) and how your language can divide that mass of reality into manageable parts in a different way than English. And think about additional, perhaps figurative, senses of a word (like all those extra meanings for "manus" or "hand").
You can even create words for concepts that are only very clumsily expressed in English, such as: "that awkward situation when something has happened, which is known to more than one present party, which neither wish to speak about, and suddenly they have nothing to say to each other". Another word could mean the same thing, but with another, unknowing party present, who senses a weird atmosphere between the other parties.
Part of the challenge of conlanging — whether you're building an artlang, engelang, or auxlang — is that you won't really know how your language is going to feel until you've got enough of it together to start saying interesting things in it. (That's also one reason why conlangers may tend to keep tinkering with their creations.) So how can you tell, early in building your vocabulary, whether it will come out too much like English? Well, as a rule of thumb, building a vocabulary of a hundred words or so should be a pretty massive job — done properly, it's a major milestone, like a small company landing its first big client — and each additional hundred words should be heavy work as well. If you easily reach, say, a thousand words, you're probably in real danger of producing a conlang that will always feel too much like your native language, no matter what sounds and grammar you give it.
OK, you have your sounds and words, but you think that this alphabet we use is boring? Well, you're in luck! This page will give you a few hints and tips about creating your own writing system, commonly called a "conscript".
To make an interesting writing system the last thing you want to do is copy the Roman script. So, before you actually start to create any glyphs (symbols), you will need to decide what kind of script you would like to make. Scripts are divided up by how many sounds are expressed per glyph.
Naturally, you are not limited to just these types. You can modify or combine them to fit your language and style.
Now that you have chosen the type of script you want, you get to design the glyphs themselves. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
Okay, now you have your sounds and your symbols but you have one more thing to figure out: which way the words will be written.
You then need to find out which way the lines will go. For example, Japanese is sometimes written top to bottom with vertical lines going right to left. Arabic goes right to left but the lines go top to bottom horizontally. Some writing systems like Ogham are sometimes even written in a circle.
Now you can write in your own script!
Here are answers to some frequently asked questions related to conlanging.
There are many ways that people communicate with each other, but we don't usually call all of them "language". So presumably, any definition of the word should be somewhat selective.
When "linguists" talk about language, they usually refer to communication that uses very specific parts of the brain (the Broca's and Wernicke's areas), and that has, as a result, some very peculiar characteristics that may be due to the architecture of those areas. For example:
If we follow all of the above rules, then there are just two or three basic sorts of languages in the world — spoken languages, like English or French or German (it doesn't matter if they're sometimes represented in writing); sign languages, like American Sign Language; and, to some extent, written languages. Encodings, like Morse code, Semaphore, etc., aren't language in themselves, although they can be used to directly "represent" language.
The status of written language is a bit complicated. Writing is often treated as just a representation of spoken language, in which case it's an encoding and not language in itself. There exist conlangs that are purely written, though, with no spoken form at all, like X; these clearly aren't encodings of something else. They might fail the test of being learnable natively — but most conlangs are never learned natively by anyone (the biggest exception being Esperanto, with perhaps a thousand native speakers), so whether most conlangs "could" be learned natively is already a matter for speculation.
When a spoken language has an extensive literary tradition, the spoken form of the language tends to change faster than the written form, so that after a while the language has two different registers — a formal (or "literary") register and an informal (or "vulgar") register. This effect is called diglossia. The different registers aren't "usually" considered separate languages as such; but since, for example, written English is often the common language shared by native speakers of English and American Sign Language, some have suggested that perhaps written English should be considered distinct from both. That would mean that if you both speak and write English, you're bilingual.
Also, when any encoding is used intensively for direct communication, rather than just as a transcription of speech, the encoding tends to develop idioms of its own that don't come from the language it supposedly represents. In Morse code, for example, the "abbreviation" for laughter is HI, because of how it sounds "in Morse code" (not because of how the represented letters sound in spoken language):  . That doesn't make Morse code a language, but it's one small step in that direction. Written languages may develop small flourishes like that as well, like emoticons.
Other forms of communication, like traffic signs, hand gestures (that are not structured signing), dogs barking, bees dancing (even assuming that is communication, which is debated), etc. are not languages, in the linguists' sense.
Yes — but probably not in the way most people think.
Some languages have been written down for a long time, have lots of literature and poetry to go with them, and have thick grammars too. These languages are "richer" in the sense that they may have a bigger vocabulary and a richer library of cultural links and so on. But they are not more "complicated".
Linguists have found that pretty much all languages, from those spoken by the simplest nomads to the builders of great empires, are all about similarly "complicated", in the sense that they all have the complex structures necessary to convey human thought and reason. The aboriginal languages of North America, for example, have been found to have massive verb tables that put Latin and Greek to shame. And while languages like English and Chinese don't have these verb tables, they do have complicated systems of syntax (or sentence structures) that put those North American languages to shame.
What about people who say, for example, that "Spanish is easier to learn than German"? Well — a lot of this depends on the way the language is taught in schools, the amount of sheer memorization demanded of beginners, and how "similar" the language is to your native language. If you're a native English speaker, for example, you may find Japanese baffling, but Korean people usually find Japanese easier to learn than English!
Simple languages do exist, in two ways. Pidgins are broken, halting "languages" that people who can't speak each other's languages end up speaking. If these pidgins are taught to children in a community, however, they tend to become full languages within a generation — what we call creoles — so a pidgin can be seen as a new language in the process of birth. On the other hand, dying languages are languages that few people speak, and therefore aren't really being taught to children — these languages tend to get simpler and then die out.
It's very hard to know, since we didn't have tape recorders back then. We are reasonably sure, however, that language has been spoken for a very very long time, tens of thousands of years at least, many centuries before agriculture or civilization began anywhere in the world. This is because all people everywhere today, in every corner of the world, speak languages as complex as everyone else's.
By the way, languages did not begin in Egypt or Sumeria (as far as we know, anyway). Those were just the first cultures we know of to "write down" languages that they already spoke. Languages must have been spoken by all human beings many millennia before that.
A language has a unique grammar, phonology, vocabulary, and set of "roots" from which new words can be derived. All natural languages are descended from parent languages, as well, though for conlangs this is not strictly necessary.
A code or cipher, on the other hand, is merely a way of changing one language into something else. Codes and ciphers have no set grammar, vocabulary, or anything like that, and usually exist solely for the purpose of obscuring communication. 
Too many people will get a dictionary and create a single counterpart for every word in there and then proclaim, "Look! I invented a language!" No, there's more to a real language than that. And a real language is what real minds create!
If you hang around conlangers for long, you'll hear references to "Whorfianism" or the "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis". Those are two names for the same thing, which also goes by other names such as "principle of linguistic relativity".
Simply put, the hypothesis says that how a person thinks depends on the language they use to think about it. Modern writers usually distinguish between a "strong hypothesis", that your language forces you to think one way rather than another, and a "weak hypothesis" that your language encourages you to think one way rather than another. Nowadays the strong hypothesis isn't really taken seriously by mainstream linguists, but most linguists believe some version of a weak Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Lots of conlangs explore some version or other of the hypothesis.
The idea is most closely associated with Benjamin Lee Whorf, 1897–1941, who studied native North American languages of the Uto-Aztecan family — which are dramatically differently structured from European languages — and suggested that speaking such profoundly different languages would give a person a different way of looking at the world. Einstein's theory of relativity was a recent development at the time, and Whorf likened this linguistic notion to Einstein's theory because physical relativity says that how you perceive the world depends on your physical reference frame, while linguistic relativity says that how you perceive the world depends on your language. Edward Sapir, 1884–1939, is an important figure in the early history of modern linguistics, and Whorf's mentor. Sapir too expressed ideas of this sort. It's pretty common, though, for an idea to get named after somebody without their having ever actually said it; Sapir and Whorf both said things like this at various times, but they weren't the first to do so, never coauthored a paper about it, didn't present it as a hypothesis, and dabbled in stronger and weaker forms without explicitly making the modern strong/weak distinction.
Many loglangs are at least partly explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; but also some philosophical languages are as well, such as Láadan, a well-known conlang attempting to support women's thinking, which was used in a series of feminist science fiction novels.
Short answer: There is now. A central place to look, from which to work outward to all the other parts of the modern conlanging community, is the Language Creation Society.
Before the Internet, conlanging was mostly done privately by individuals who had no way of knowing if anyone else shared their peculiar pursuit. In a (now classic) lecture about artlanging in 1931, called "A Secret Vice", J.R.R. Tolkien described an experience as a soldier in World War I:
J.R.R. Tolkien helped make artlanging somewhat respectable: as an academic and scholar of ancient languages, he not only came out publicly as a committed designer of artistic fictional languages, but used those languages to create a hugely successful series of novels. When the internet came along, people who had never before been able to "find" others with the same eccentric interests began to discover each other and form on-line communities, and one of these groups was conlangers. The conlanging community especially formed around the Conlang Mailing List, created in 1991, which was the origin of the term "conlang". The first annual Language Creation Conference was held in 2006, and the Language Creation Society, which amongst other things now runs the annual conference, was formed the next year.
Some conlangers enjoy inventing weird features for their conlangs, but then discover some time later that there is actually a natural human language that has that feature. A classic case is the "Monster Raving Loony" alignment (we'll discuss alignment in the Advanced level), which was devised by members of the Conlang Mailing List who named it "Monster Raving Loony" because it would create inherent ambiguity in the language — making it impossible to tell which of the two arguments to a transitive verb is the subject of the sentence — and therefore seemed absurd. Only then someone noticed a language in Iran that actually has that sort of alignment.
This phenomenon is so common that conlangers have a name for it. It's called anadewism — which is an acronym for another natlang already dunnit, except worse.
So, when you're having fun with some really weird feature in your conlang, don't let it interfere with your enjoyment when you discover there's a natlang that does something like it!
You may contribute any linguistic knowledge you have, but
A high-quality module will be easy to understand while going in-depth, and will explain early and often how it could be used in a conlang. Examples are important, and detailed explanations are great things to have, without being redundant or droning on. So get out there and write some great modules!
The Intermediate level of this book is for those familiar with the basic elements of conlangs (or of languages in general) who want to learn how to create a conlang with added depth. It aims to familiarize you with the internal structure of different elements of language, and basic terminology for discussing them. It assumes prior familiarity with technical terms only up to the minimal level explained by the Beginner level.
The terminology explained in this level, and the analysis of language structure described by that terminology, are useful tools for conlanging. They give you a map with which to navigate the vast territory of language. However, as you study these useful tools, remember that the map is not the territory.
For one thing, they are tools of "analysis", and that doesn't necessarily suit them for "constructing" languages. By breaking something into pieces you can describe it, and then try to figure out how it was put together in the first place; but the way you broke it down probably "isn't" the way it was put together, especially if it's something really complex. Language — as has been noted in the conlanging community — is the most complex thing humans do. Strange natlang features aren't random; if you use linguists' analysis as a menu of things to do, rather than working from "why and how" those features come about, your conlang likely won't feel naturalistic.
Linguists' analysis of language may only sometimes work. There are languages that don't have syllables (or so some linguists figure). Sometimes it's hard to be sure when things are or aren't separate words. Words often don't classify neatly into standard parts of speech. Or, the analysis may be (or may be "suspected" to be) purely descriptive, with no causal structure behind it; some linguists have suggested that "ergativity" (a feature that has enjoyed some popularity amongst conlangers, and which we'll get to in the Advanced level) is just a superficial characteristic of language, the way "has blue feathers" is a superficial characteristic of some birds that doesn't really tell you anything important about bird biology.
The terminology and analysis offered here "is" useful; we need some way to talk about language. Just don't let it limit your understanding, or your creativity.
Each section is designed to cover details of a different facet of languages, natural and constructed. The sections are:
It's all very well having a conlang full of cool sounding words, but if you don't know how your conlang uses those words to form sentences then you won't be able to express even a concept as simple as "The boy bounced the ball". This is what grammar is for.
As we noted earlier, there are two main types of grammar:
Both of these processes are very important for the grammar of your conlang. In this section we will learn more about how to create a good grammar.
In the Beginner Grammar section we learned about the terms Morphology and Syntax and talked a little about what they mean, but we didn't really go into much depth. Let's do that now.
Linguists traditionally divide a language's grammar up into two sub-disciplines called Morphology and Syntax. Morphology deals with the way in which parts of words, called morphemes, stems or affixes, can be put together to make new words with new meanings. Syntax, on the other hand, deals with the way groups of words, called phrases or clauses, can be rearranged within a sentence to make a new sentence with a new meaning. The important distinction here is that morphology happens inside words (using word-parts), while syntax happens outside words (using word-groups).
Sometimes it's hard to draw the line between these two sub-disciplines. In Mandarin (a language spoken in China), for example, the word "to eat" is 吃 "chi1", like in 吃面 "chi1mian4" "to eat noodles". However, 吃 "chi1" is not used alone, so "to eat" without any object is translated 吃饭 "chi1fan4" (literally, "to eat rice"). It's hard to tell whether 吃面 "chi1mian4" and 吃饭 "chi1fan4" are phrases with a word 吃 "chi1" or new words with a root 吃 "chi1".
To be useful, a language's grammar has to be able to express all the kinds of things that a speaker of that language might want to say. Whether the grammar uses syntax or morphology to express these concepts depends on the language. Languages can be categorised by whether they use more syntax (called isolating) or more morphology (called synthetic); for example, English has more syntax so it is isolating, whereas Ojibwe (a North-American indigenous language) has more morphology so it is synthetic.
The parts of this section are:
Nouns and verbs are great, but sooner or later you'll want to start describing them; sure, you've got a fruit, but what colour is it? What shape is it? Is it hard or soft? How bouncy is it? To answer questions like these you'll probably want some "adjectives".
Everyone learns in school that adjectives are words that describe a noun. Because of their close relationship with nouns, many languages will force their adjectives to "agree" with the noun they're modifying. Most of the time this means that adjectives will have different forms depending on the form of their noun. Adjectives can agree with any of the details that we discussed back in nominal morphology: Case, Number, Gender, or anything else that a language might decide to mark on its nouns.
In English, we have nothing like this, so just to make it a little easier to understand here's an example of how English verbs and nouns inflect to match each other.
To any English speaker that sounds incorrect. The problem is that "horses" is a "plural" word, and "eats" is the third person "singular" verb "to eat". To make this correct you would have to change the noun to its singular form:
The other possibility would be to change "eats" to a plural:
Now that's slightly awkward because it means a bunch of horses are eating one apple, but it's grammatically correct. In many languages, adjectives have to match nouns in the same way that English verbs have to match their subjects. Let's pretend that English had adjectival inflection for a moment. What would it look like?
Singular noun phrases (remember "noun phrases" from earlier?) could look just as they do in real-world English: "solid table", "happy child", "brown dog", "tall woman". Suppose that plural noun phrases had the plural ending "-s" on adjectives: "solids tables", "happys children", "browns dogs", "talls women" — these would all be correct in this hypothetical version of English. The adjectives would become "plural" along with the nouns they modified.
Don't get the impression that the affix that is added to the adjective has to look the same as the one that is added to the noun. I could have said that our hypothetical English has plural adjectives ending with "-pa"; "solidpa tables", "happypa children", &c. It's just that "-s" is a very natural sounding suffix in English.
Returning to reality, languages that have agreement on their adjectives include Greek, Latin, Polish, and Russian. Esperanto is an example of a conlang which does this too: "alta viro" (a tall man), "altaj viroj" (tall men). Some languages, such as German, have a complex system of adjectival endings which depend on the gender, number and case of the noun, as well as what type of determiner, if any, precedes the adjective. (Determiners are words like 'a', 'the', 'this', 'all', 'my' etc.)
Remember, any concept that can be marked on the noun can also be agreed with by the adjective, so be inventive. In your own language you may choose to have a similarly complex system, a simple system, or no adjective inflections at all.
The most common kind of inflection that is found only on adjectives, rather than applied to adjectives in agreement with nouns, is "comparison". In English, we have three different "degrees" of comparison; "positive", "comparative", and "superlative".
Comparison is a way that two nouns that both possess a certain quality (specified by an adjective) can be compared. Many Indo-European languages have this three-degree system; in some languages, as in English, some words are inflected, some have distinct words for the different forms () while others have their comparative forms marked with separate particles. Here's a table of some of the English forms:
There are other possibilities, as well. A system of augmentative or diminutive affixes might be used for both nouns and adjectives, and take the place of comparative forms; so the same affix might turn "hill" into "mountain" and "strong" into "stronger" or "very strong". There might be only two, or more than three degrees of comparison in the system.
Most people think of adverbs as being just like adjectives except that they help to describe verbs instead of nouns. But actually, adverbs can be used to describe more than just verbs:
This apparent versatility comes from the fact that adverbs are a "catch-all" category. That is, when people find a word that isn't a noun, verb, or other known part of speech they'll usually call it an adverb regardless of whether it can be used to describe verbs.
In English, French, Greek and many other Indo-European languages it makes sense to describe verbs, adjectives, and adverbs as three different "parts of speech". But in some languages, like German or Turkish, adjectives and adverbs are essentially the same part of speech; the same word in the same form can modify a noun or a verb, if it makes sense to do so. For example, in English we use an adjective like "fast" to describe nouns and an adverb like "swiftly" to describe verbs, but German uses the word "schnell" for both.
In some other languages, there is no distinct category of adjectives as opposed to verbs; the meanings expressed by adjectives in English, Greek and so forth are expressed by "stative" intransitive verbs. Esperanto allows modifier root words to be inflected as adjectives, adverbs or stative verbs as the speaker thinks suitable:
So far we've looked at various kinds of words and how those words can be modified in different ways to create subtle variations in meaning. This is all very well and good, but sometimes you'll find yourself wanting to express some meaning that is too complicated for a single word to express, and that's when you'll want to use "clauses".
Let's run through an example: "The bicycle rolled down the hill" is a perfectly reasonable sentence. But let's say that we wanted to give more information about this bicycle. If we wanted to mention that the bicycle is blue then we can just use the adjective "blue"; "The blue bicycle rolled down the hill". But let's say we wanted to say something more complicated, such as the fact that I just bought this bicycle yesterday. One option might be to use two separate sentences to express this concept; "The bicycle rolled down the hill. I just bought it yesterday.". The problem with this is that it is long and cumbersome. What would be great is if we could somehow take that second sentence and jam it into the first sentence right next to the word "bicycle" just like we did with "blue". Something like "The 'I-just-bought-this-bicycle-yesterday' bicycle rolled down the hill".
A relative clause will allow us to do exactly that.
A relative clause is a sentence that that is pretending to be an adjective in the sense that it is describing a noun. For this reason they are sometimes also called "adjectival clauses". We create a relative clause in English by taking a complete sentence and removing the noun that we are describing and adding the special word "that" to the beginning of the sentence. When we jam a relative clause into another sentence in English we have to put it "after" the noun that it's describing.
In our example above, we wanted to take the sentence "I just bought it yesterday" and turn it into a relative clause. The noun that we're describing is the bicycle which is here represented by the pronoun "it". If we follow the steps we end up with the clause "that I just bought yesterday". So our full and complete sentence should look something like this:
Perfect. That's exactly what we wanted.
By the way, be very careful with the word "that" in English. "That" has quite a lot of uses and just because you see this word doesn't mean you have a relative clause on your hands. In fact the word "that" isn't even always needed when you're making relative clauses; we could just as easily said this:
Here's a few more examples of sentences that contain relative clauses.
Japanese and Korean, both being verb-final languages, place their relative clause "before" the noun that it is modifying.
Nominal clauses take the place of nouns.
Adverbial clauses act like adverbs.
Clauses of time determine "when" something happened.
Adverbial clauses that justify the meaning of the clause they determine are called "clauses of reason".
Examples:
She left "because she was in a hurry".
You won't go, "since you can't".
Adverbial clauses that show the purpose, the objective of the subject of the verb they determine.
Examples:
She left early, "(so as/in order) to catch the bus".
So far we've mostly concentrated on using affixes and other processes to create slight variations on the words that we already have. For example, "dogs" is just a variation of "dog" meaning that there is more than one of them, but they still both refer to a particular kind of four-legged animal. This is called "inflection".
In contrast, words like "dogpile", "doggedly", and "hot dog" are obviously related to the word "dog", but they don't refer to the same thing. It's time to dive into "derivation".
There are two major sub-fields of derivation; compounding and affixing. Compounding means putting whole words together to form a new word, as in the following examples:
Notice that in all these compound words, the second word determines the general kind of thing the compound refers to, and the first word makes it more specific. A roommate is a kind of mate, not a kind of room; a bluebird is a kind of bird, not a shade of the color blue; to babysit is to take care of (sit with) a baby (or other child), not to baby a sit (if that means anything). Because of this we say that compound words in English follow a "modifier-head" order: the modifier morpheme comes first, and then the head morpheme. Some other languages have head-modifier order. 
Affixing is when you use affixes to change the meaning of a root in a more or less predictable way. Examples from English include:
One of the major uses for derivational affixes is to change the type of word; turn a noun into a verb for example. In the example above you can see that the English affix -er takes a verb (such as "to work") and turns it into a noun ("worker"). There are all sorts of affixes for all the major transformations.
It's possible to apply more than one such transformation at a time; a noun like "concept" can become an adjective with the addition of "-al", "conceptual" can become a verb with "-ize", and "conceptualize" can come full circle to a noun with "-ation", conceptualization.
In some languages these means of deriving new words are more "productive" than in others. Languages like German and Esperanto give the individual speaker great freedom to coin new compounds and affixed words as needed, while languages like French are more restrictive, usually tending to use phrases for things German might coin a new compound for. English is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. This may be partly a matter of culture as well as linguistic structure.
We'll start our exploration of grammar by examining the ways that words can be altered and rearranged to create new meanings. For now, try not to focus on the actual meaning that's being conveyed, but rather on the way that that meaning is constructed.
The morphological ways of marking a word are often referred to under the collective term affixes. There are lots of different types of affixes and we'll look at some of the most common ones here.
Prefixes and suffixes are small word fragments that are added to the beginning or end of a word in order to change its meaning. Prefixes are added to the beginning of a word and suffixes are added to the end.
Prefixes and suffixes are a very important way for a language to change the meanings of words. Almost every language has them to some degree. In English, among other things, we use suffixes to show plurals on most nouns and the past tense on most verbs;
An example of an English prefix would be the negative prefix un-;
It's also possible to put an affix "inside" a word; these kind of affixes are called infixes and they're less common than either prefixes or suffixes. For example, the language Tagalog sometimes forms the active voice by infixing the affix -um-:
Another example of an infix occurs in the conlang Quenya, where the past tense forms of some verbs are formed by infixing -n- (and also suffixing -e);
Apophony (sometimes referred to as simulfixes) is when you change the sounds that make up a word. The best way to describe apophony is to show you an example. In English we sometimes change the vowels in a noun to show that it's plural;  becomes ,  becomes , and  becomes .
What's happening here is that the vowels are all moving towards the front of the mouth. The change that occurs is always systematic, for example, all the vowels in a word moving to the front (as we see above). If this reminds you of sandhi, it should. Apophony is just a sandhi rule that happens to be triggered by some process happening in the grammar, whereas with sandhi the trigger is purely phonological.
When apophony occurs on vowels it is often called ablaut while on consonants it's mutation.
An example of consonant apophony, or mutation, occurs in the Welsh language. In Welsh, nouns that start with consonants will sometimes change that consonant to a different one when they are preceded by certain grammatical words. Different changes happen with different words and it isn't just grammatical words that can trigger the change. For example, the Welsh word for "stone" is , but "the stone" is , "my stone" is  and "her stone" is .
Reduplication is when a part of a word is repeated in order to change its meaning. The affix-y name for this is duplifix. The repeated part of the word can go anywhere around (or in) the original word.
The Indonesian language uses this, often to pluralize things. For example, "sayur" (vegetable) will become "sayur-mayur" (vegetables), or "sayur-sayuran" (vegetables, but can also translate as artificial vegetables).
In English reduplication isn't used very much at all, but one use for it is as an intensifier, to try to make the meaning of a word stronger; "super" is reduplicated to "super-duper". It's also sometimes used in baby-talk. An emerging reduplication is used to qualify a word, for example, "He's smart but he's not smart smart."
In Jewish English, schm- replaces the initial consonant in a reduplicated word in a response to be dismissive. For example, "I need a new hat." "Hat schmat. You need a whole new outfit."
In Chinese, reduplication can be used be used with nouns for plurals, and, in Cantonese, with adjectives plus -dei to mean somewhat [adjective].
Function words are basically the syntactic versions of prefixes and suffixes. The difference from them is that function words are whole words that, instead of being fixed to another word, are simply juxtaposed next to it. Function words in English include everything from the articles (a, the), to the prepositions (in, for, over), to the final element in phrasal verbs (to put "off", to eat "out").
Because they are a syntactic phenomenon, function words don't just act on single words; they can act on whole phrases. For example, the article "the" in the phrase "the house" only affects the one word "house", but the preposition "in" in the phrase "in the house where I grew up" affects the whole phrase "the house where I grew up".
A clitic is sort of like a cross between an affix and a function word; it's physically attached to a word and affects it phonologically like an affix, but grammatically it acts at the level of phrases like a function word.
An example of a clitic in English is the possessive 's (as in "the boy's bike"). So why is this a clitic and not a suffix? Here's why... suppose that you wanted to express the concept that "the castle" belongs to "the king". You'd say "the king's castle". Now suppose that you wanted to say that "the castle" belongs to both "the king" and "the queen". If the possessive 's was really a suffix then you'd have to say "the king's and queen's castle" (two s'), but you don't, you say "the king and queen's castle" (one 's). This is because the possessive s is a clitic and is capable of governing the whole phrase "the king and queen" rather than just "the king" and "the queen" separately.
You can add words to a sentence to alter its meaning, but much simpler thing todo is to just change their order. All words have to come in "some" order so many languages think that you might as well make use of that fact and assign meanings to particular orders of words. In English, we use word order to tell who is doing what to whom; the only difference between the sentences ""The girl can see the cat."" and ""The cat can see the girl."" is the order of the words, and yet they seem to have almost opposite meanings. Furthermore, sometimes in English we can take a statement and turn it into a question by moving the verb to the front of the sentence; ""Can the girl see the cat?"". The actual process is slightly more complicated than moving verbs around, but it shows you how a language can affect meaning without adding more words.
As you probably know, nouns are words which stand for things; they refer to a specific object or concept. In this section we'll explore the different things that languages can do with their nouns.
The first thing that you need to decide about your conlang's nouns is what categories they are marked for. Some of the grammatical categories they can be marked for include:
Not all languages mark all of these categories, and some that mark them may mark them only on articles or adjectives instead of directly on nouns. For instance, the conlang Thauliralau marks number, gender and definiteness with articles, leaving the nouns entirely uninflected. Quenya marks its nouns for case and number directly on the noun by adding certain endings to them. Amman-Iar marks its nouns for definiteness, among other categories. marks its words (which don't easily divide into "nouns" and "verbs") for many other categories as well.
"Case" inflection is perhaps the most important inflection that a noun has, and all conlangs will have to deal with it to some extent. Cases are used to show the role a noun plays in a sentence. It is used extensively in languages like Greek, Latin, Finnish, and Hungarian.
Back in the Beginners Grammar section we learned about the terms subject, verb, and object. To refresh your memory; the subject shows who or what in the sentence is performing the action and the object shows who or what is being acted upon. In the sentence "the dog bit the man", "dog" is the subject and "man" is the object.
In English, we tell what noun is the subject and what noun is the object by looking at the order of the words in the sentence (Subject-Verb-Object). But not all languages do it that way. Many languages use cases to show that distinction. They put the subject of the sentence into what is called the and the object of the sentence into the . This means an affix (usually a suffix) is put onto a word, for example in Latin, "canis (dog) in the nominative form, and "canem is its accusative form with its "–em" suffix, and the same for "vir", with its accusative form being "virum. So the sentence "the dog bit the man" in Latin is not ""canis momordit vir"" but ""canis momordit virum".
Most of the time, English doesn't do anything like this; the words "man" and "dog" look exactly the same in both "the dog bit the man" and "the man bit the dog". However English does use cases when it comes to its ; the pronouns change their form depending on whether they are nominative or accusative. For example, the pronoun "he" is nominative, but it's accusative form is "him". Notice the differences between "He bit the dog" and "The dog bit him".
There's another case that works in a similar way. Up until now, we've been calling words like "man" in "the dog bit the man" the object of the sentence, but actually, it's the direct object. Some sentences also have a second object called the indirect object.
An example of the indirect object would be the word "girl" in "the boy gave the girl a gift". An indirect object is an object that is involved in the action of the verb but isn't directly acted upon; the "boy" isn't doing anything to the "girl", he's doing something to the "gift" (i.e. giving it), but the girl is receiving the gift so she must nonetheless be involved in the action.
Like the other two cases, English mostly uses the order of the words to tell which is the direct object and which is the indirect object; the indirect usually comes before the direct. As you may have guessed, other languages might use a case to show the indirect object. When they do, this case is usually called the .
One case which English "does" have is the . This case is mostly used to show possession — that somebody owns something. The English genitive case is what we're using when we add Apostrophe-S to the end of a noun; "the king's horses" "Tom's ball".
Cases can also be used to express some of the same sorts of things that English uses prepositions for. In English, when we want to talk about the location of something we use a preposition such as in, but in Finnish, they use the ending -ssa; "talo" "house" becomes "talossa" "in [a] house".
There are a great variety of cases that work like this so I'll just list some of the more common ones and their nearest English prepositions as a starting point for your own research.
When you're making your conlang, at the very least you'll need to think about how you're going to show which noun is the subject and which is the object; be it case, or word-order, or something else entirely. Once you have that, you can go on to work out whether you want your language to have some or all of these cases that we've just explored. Keep in mind that it's common for a language to have multiple ways to say the same thing. For example, in English we can use the genitive case to show possession, but we can also use the preposition of; "the king's horses" or "the horses of the king".
"Number" need not be just singular and plural like it is in English. Some natural languages have dual (two things, or pairs of things), trial (three things), and paucal (a few things) number inflection as well.
A few conlangs have other interesting numbers; for instance, an "all" number that refers to the whole set of "noun" everywhere, or all of them within a given context; or a "zero" number inflection that would occur where other languages would use singular or plural noun preceded or followed by a word meaning "none". Quenya — in addition to a singular, plural, and dual — has a partitive plural which is used to represent fractions of the whole.
Not all the nouns in your language need to follow the same number scheme; you can have a particular group of nouns that inflect for a paucal number while the rest don't, or whatever you want.
An important concept is that of the mass noun. There are quite a few languages that have mass nouns, but how they work differs slightly for each one. Usually it has to do with a word presenting the object it's referring to as an unbounded mass of stuff, as opposed to discrete units. A regular, non-mass noun is called a count noun.
There "is" a tendency for nouns referring to powders, liquids, and substances to be mass nouns, but whether the word for an object in a particular language is a mass noun is not wholly dependent on the nature of the object itself. For example, in English the word "furniture" is a mass noun, but the extremely similar word "appliance" (as in "household appliance") is not. There is no reason why it couldn't be one in your conlang.
Also, what is a mass noun in one language can be a count noun in another, for example one cannot say "three informations", but you can say that in French, "trois informations" means "three pieces of information". Bear this in mind when creating your conlang.
Definiteness is a tricky subject to grasp. There are two major types of definiteness: definite and indefinite. Definite nouns are nouns that refer to specific entities such as something that you've already talked about. Indefinite nouns refer to a class of entities in general or are used to introduce a new and previously unknown entity into the conversation.
Definite nouns are shown in English with the function word "the" or other determiners such as "one" or "their". Indefinite nouns are shown either by using one of "a", "an", or "some", or by using no qualifying word at all. For example: "the cat", "the cats", and "my cats" are all definite, whereas "a cat", "cats", and "some cats" are all indefinite. Words like these that mark definiteness are common enough that they have their own term: articles.
You don't have to use articles in your conlang the same way English does. In German, the articles don't just show definiteness, they also tell you what case the noun is. In fact, you don't have to have articles at all; many languages show definiteness with various affixes or clitics or don't show it explicitly at all.
We'll explore articles more thoroughly in the section on adjectives.
If you've ever had lessons on another European language other than English then you'll probably think that gender is whether something is "masculine" or "feminine" (and possibly others such as "neuter" or "common"). To some extent, you're correct. Gender in French or Spanish or German or any other Indo-European language "is" about sorting nouns into sexually distinguished categories. 
However, many natural languages don't use sex as the basis of their gender system and instead divide their nouns into animate and inanimate, for instance, and some have larger numbers of genders. It is for this reason that gender is often referred to as noun class in linguistic circles. You can be as creative as you want when it comes to your noun classes. To give you a taste; the Dyirbal language has a noun class that contains words for women, animals, water, fire, and violence, and another noun class that contains only words for edible plants.
If you want your conlang to be naturalistic then it's generally a good idea to have some words that are in noun classes that don't match their meaning (e.g. Greek and Latin had words for "child" in the neuter gender as well as many words for inanimate things in the masculine and feminine genders).
It is often wondered by non-linguists what gender is actually "for"; its uses aren't immediately obvious. Like case, it can be used to "tie" the parts of the sentence together; a language which has gender can link adjectives and nouns (and sometimes even verbs!) together without necessarily putting them in a strict order. It can also be used to discriminate between two or more "third person" arguments in a sentence or text. Consider the English text:
This sentence is understandable because "Bill", "Jane", and the "bike" all have different gendered pronouns that we can use to distinguish them. Bill has he/him/his, Jane has she/her/her, and the bike has it/it/its.
If, instead, we were to change "Bill" into "Betty" and change the "bike" into a female "doll" then we can plausibly refer to all three of the nouns using just the feminine pronouns. The sentence then becomes much harder to understand:
It isn't clear whose house or doll it is, nor who is doing the showing or liking, nor who (or what) is being shown something or liked.
Once you know what distinctions your nouns can make, you'll want to start thinking about noun phrases. A noun phrase is a bunch of words collected together that act like a basic noun. Usually noun phrases will have at least one head noun.
Let's try an example; examine the sentence "the ball broke the window". This sentence has two nouns in it; "ball" and "window". It also has two noun phrases in it; "the ball" and "the window". Notice how both noun phrases have a noun combined with other words. These other words are modifiers that narrow down the meaning of the noun they're with. In this particular case you've only got one modifier, the word "the" which is telling you that the noun is definite.
A key feature of a noun phrase is that it is interchangeable, syntactically speaking, with other noun phrases. For example we might decide to swap the phrase "the ball" with the phrase "a rock"; ""the ball" broke the window" becomes ""a rock" broke the window". These substitutions don't actually have to make sense; ""a brief feeling of compassion" broke the window". What's important here is that the substitution "feels right"; the sentence is grammatical and doesn't make you feel linguistically "uncomfortable". Contrast this with a sentence like "'ate an apple quickly' broke the window", which is more definitively wrong ("ate an apple quickly" is not a noun phrase).
These are only simple noun phrases, but languages can and do make more complicated ones; "the red ball", "my left foot", "you and me", "the film I saw last night", and even "three brown rabbits from out of that field with the trees and broken fence around it".
We'll discuss how your conlang can go about making noun phrases like these later on, but for now, you just need to understand what a noun phrase is.
"TODO: perhaps put some emphasis on identifying the head of the phrase."
The morphology of verbs can be as rich as that of nouns;
Every speaker of English should be familiar with verb tenses. They show "when" (relative to the current time) the action is taking place. Tense is traditionally split into three distinctions: "past", "present", and "future".
However, real languages don't always divide time up in the same way. For example, a language can have a distinction between the far-past and the near-past, or it could do away with distinguishing the present and the future on the verb — It may surprise you to learn that the latter is exactly what English does; English verbs inflect for "past" and "nonpast", and the so-called "future tense" is formed with an auxiliary verb ("will" or "shall") plus the nonpast verb form. Some languages even do away with tense inflection altogether, showing time when relevant with (e.g.) adverbs or phrases.
Aspect is the inflection of a verb to show how the action is distributed in time. It includes, most basically, a distinction between "perfective" (completed) and "imperfect" (incompleted). Other aspects, such as the "habitual" (occurring regularly over a period of time) and the "iterative" (done repeatedly), may be found in some languages. Many languages conflate tense and aspect in verbal morphology, so a verb has forms for imperfect past tense vs. perfect past tense.
To give you a better feel for this, in English, verbs are normally imperfect but can be made perfect by turning it into a passive participle and adding the auxiliary verb "have" to the sentence: Contrast "Tom "ate" his lunch" and "Tom "has eaten" his lunch". The habitual aspect is more subtle, but can be most easily seen in the distinction between the so-called "simple present" and the "complex present" tenses: Compare "The penguins "eat" fish" and "The penguins "are eating" fish". Other aspects have no really good construction in English and so we often have to rely on implication and adverbial phrases to get the point across.
Mood (sometimes also called mode) shows a verb's relationship to reality and includes things like the "indicative" (it happens as stated) vs. the "subjunctive" (it might happen, it is desired to happen) or "imperative" (it is commanded to happen). Some languages treat "negation" (it doesn't happen) or "questions" (is it happening?) as mood inflections on verbs.
Some languages use moods where we use modal verbs (e.g. can, may, will etc.), for example where we say "I would drink", the Spanish say "(yo) bebería", from "beber". Where we say "He wants to drink", Sanskrit says "pípāsati". And where we say "it is likely that he speaks", Finnish expresses it with "puhunee".
Some languages indicate how the speaker knows the verb is happening as a kind of mood, called "evidentiality" ("I know because I saw it", "I know because I'm guessing it will happen", or "It's hearsay" etc.). Conlangs with extensive evidentiality marking include and Qthyn|gai.
Agreement is when a verb is given markings that refer to some detail from another part of the sentence. Most forms of agreement focus around the subject of the sentence but the verbs of some languages will mark details of the object (usually in addition to the subject).
Many languages inflect the verb for the person. Latin and Spanish, for example, have different verb forms depending on whether the subject is "first person", "second person", or "third person", which is reflected on the last syllable or two of the word ("hablo" "I speak", "hablamos" "we speak", etc.) whereas English does this only for the third person singular ("he runs" versus "they run"). In languages where verbs inflect for person, it is often possible to omit pronouns altogether and still be understood; in some such languages, subject pronouns are "normally" omitted, and only included for special emphasis. 
Some languages may include gender-marking on verbs instead of/as well as person marking. For example, in Russian, the "past tense" is formed by using a form ending in -l, -la, -lo, depending on the gender of the subject (while in the "present tense" the verb agrees with the person of the subject and not with the gender). In Arabic, most tense forms indicate the person, number (singular, dual, or plural) and gender of the subject.
Some languages (e.g. Basque, Georgian, Quenya) mark the verb for the person not only of the subject but of the object. Thus "I have found it" in Quenya becomes u-túvie-nye-s "HAVE-FIND-I-IT". One language even has forms for more than one subject "I and he", "he and they", for example.
A language may inflect the verb for all of these things or none of them. Typically, isolating/analytic languages, of course, don't inflect their verbs much. Synthetic languages, the fusional and agglutinative languages, tend to inflect their verbs to varying degrees with these features.
Some inflect heavily in one area but not another. Japanese, for example, inflects verbs not just for tense, but for politeness, desire, mood, and various other things. The verb "miru" (to see) becomes "mimasu" to show politeness and "minai" to show negation. These forms can be inflected further, so "mimashita" is the past tense form of "mimasu" and "minakatta" is the past tense form of "minai". However, Japanese verbs show no inflection whatsoever for person - there is not even an equivalent for the minimal "-s" inflection of English verbs in the 3rd person singular of the present tense.
Polysynthetic languages usually inflect the verb to an incredible degree. In such languages — like some of those spoken or formerly spoken by people native to the Americas and arguably, modern spoken French — the verb may be marked for the number, noun class, and person of both the subject and object, allowing the listener to determine which noun in a sentence is playing which role from the inflections on the verbs alone. This is another way, besides noun cases, for free word order to be possible.
Verbs can be categorized by how many arguments they take, that is, how many nouns are involved by the verb. For example in "I am writing a letter to you", the verb "write" has a valency of three because there are three things involved: the letter; you; and me, the subject. There are also verbs which have a valency of zero, as in "It rains". In English, there still has to be a subject, "it", but the sentence doesn't define what "it" is. so "it" is called "the grammatical It". In some languages, a verb with a valency of zero would simply appear by itself with no noun at all.
This is also not a new inflection of verbs, but a way of categorizing verbs by what arguments they take. Or in other words, how many "direct/indirect" objects other than the subject are involved in the action. It tells the difference between the letter and you in "I am writing a letter to you." and also describes why it sounds wrong to say "I am writing you to a letter".
Languages can change over time. The form of English that you speak is likely to be slightly different to the form of English that your parents — or grandparents — speak. For example, you may pronounce some words differently from them or there might be some words that you've heard of that they haven't (and vice-versa).
Many people underestimate the extent to which languages can change. To give you an idea, here is the Lord's Prayer as it might have been written in English over a six hundered year period:
One way that you can make your conlang more interesting is to give it a history, just like natural languages. There are many things that you can do to add history — or the appearance of history — to a conlang.
As languages change, the people who speak them sometimes split up into groups and travel apart from each other. Since there is usually very little contact between these groups, the languages that these two groups speak often change in different ways. When these languages change so much that the two groups can no longer understand one another we say that the one language has split into two separate languages and that these two languages are part of the same language family.
Natural languages almost never arise spontaneously from nothing. Usually a natural language is a changed form of some other language and is part of a family. For example, French, Portuguese, and Romanian all come from Latin. English, Swedish, and German all come from a language that we call Proto-Germanic.
When you're reading about the history of languages, you might often come across the term proto-language. A proto-language is just a language that has had new languages come out of it; a "parent" language, if you like.
There's nothing intrinsically special about proto-languages compared to non-proto-languages. The speakers of Latin and Proto-Germanic didn't know at the time that the languages they were speaking would become proto-languages. They're not neccessarily simpler or more complex than other languages and they don't have any special grammatical features. They were just in the right place at the right time to have "children".
The obvious way to make a conlang with history is to invent a proto-conlang and evolve that proto-language in the same way that a natural language might evolve. When you do that you end up with a language that looks like it has a history because it actually does have a history.
But what if you already have a mostly complete conlang and you want to give history to it? This is much harder because you will have to work backwards, slowly uncoving the proto-language. You'll almost certainly need to revise a whole bunch of stuff as you discover more about your conlang's proto-language.
If that sounds like too much work then there are a few things you can do to give a language the appearence of a history without having to invent a whole new conlang first.
Before we can do anything, we need to know how natural languages can change over time. Let's talk about sound changes.
As time progresses and a language is often used, sounds start to change; different phonemes are used. The words get "smoothed" like gravel at a beach or in a desert. After centuries the stones will be smooth. "Sound changes", as they're called, are a major driving force of language change.
Sound changes are born every time we speak. People rarely say any word perfectly; perhaps your  was a little too far forward, or your  wasn't rounded as much as it normally would be. Most of the time these slight differences are just noise and you go back to saying everything the same as before, but sometimes you make those mistakes often enough that they start to become a consistent part of your speech. Anyone who respects or admires you — even if it's just your group of friends — will start to subconsciously copy the way that you speak and that sound change will begin to spread.
Sound change is nigh unstoppable. If you write two novels in the same setting in different periods of time using the same conlang, it's quite likely some sound changes will have happened, so you'll want to implement them.
Sound change also has no memory. If at a certain point in time there are some sounds X in words, they all will change to Y even if some of them were W a few centuries ago while some have been X since the beginning of the language.
Very important is also that sound change is grammatically unrestricted. This means in simpler terms, that a sound change can not only apply to verbs, it has to apply to all words in all inflections. Only phonological constraints are allowed. For example A changes to C if it is followed by B. So in a word there is DAB which changes to DCB, but in another case the word DAE does not change. If a sound change changes one form of a word, the others only follow this change if the rule for this change applies to them too.
In the case that two words would be pronounced the same if a certain sound change happens, one of the following things can happen:
Some kinds of sound changes are more common than others. Let's take a look at the most common ones.
Assimilation is by far the most important sound change. Assimilation is when a sound changes to become more similar to the surrounding sounds. A consonant may change to match the place or type of articulation of an adjoining consonant.
Lenition is the "weakening" of sounds. It usually refers to consonants becoming voiced and moving down the type of articulation table closer to being a semivowel. It also refers to sounds that disappear altogether. Lenition is especially common intervocalically (between two vowels).
Palatalization is the shifting of a consonant towards the palate. This is a common type of assimilation. Consonants can palatalize before or after a front vowel ([], []) or a palatal consonant ([]), perhaps ending up as an affricate or fricative.
Velarization is a secondary articulation of a consonant where the back of the tongue is raised towards the velum. In some languages, such as Russian and Irish, velarized consonants often contrast with palatalized consonants.
Monophthongization is the simplification of a diphthong (or triphthong) down to a single vowel. This feature was very common in Old French and Ancient Greek, leading some the diphthongs of these languages to be monophthongized. For instance, the French  and  are now pronounced [] and []; in Modern Greek, the combinations  ει> and  οι> are pronounced [].
Vowels next to nasal consonants very often become nasal themselves. This is a type of assimilation. If a nasal consonant disappears, the mark it left on the vowel may remain, causing nasal vowels to become phonemic.
This is the change from // to a trilled //, which has occurred in various European languages. In Latin, // became // between vowels (lenition), and // then proceeded to become //. This causes alternations between // and // in some words' inflected forms: Flower is "flos" in the nominative singular, but "floris" in the genitive.
You can regularise these sounds over time. Latin did this, so that original "flos" and "honos" became "flor" and "honor", to match their genitives "floris" and "honoris".
The basic idea here is that when you're making your conlang you should have in your mind a parent language (or proto-language) and a child language. The proto-language is going to be a conlang just as we have been making up until this point and should not have any history to it. The child language is going to contain all the history. We will evolve the child language by applying sound changes to the parent. The child language is the "result"; the language that you will present to other people, or put in your novel, or whatever other reason you conlang for.
Before you begin, you may want to have some idea of the kinds of sounds that you want your child language to have. Create a rough draft of the phonology of the child language. Once you have that, you can start trying to change the phonology of the proto-language into this child draft by selecting sound changes and adding them to a list. It takes some practice to be able to do this well, so don't worry too much if the final product isn't exactly the same as your draft.
Alternatively, you can decide not to worry too much about the final product and simply select sound changes randomly. You won't have much control over what you get, but you may get something interesting.
Once you have a list of sound changes, you will want to go through the dictionary of the proto-language an apply those sound changes to every word there.
You may have noticed that applying sound changes to words is quite a tedious process. To help with this, some conlangers have written computer programs called "Sound change appliers" that automate much of this work for you.
The original and most famous sound change applier is the SCA by Zompist.
Sound change appliers are powerful and useful tools, but they can have trouble with certain kinds of changes. They can get confused by any change that needs to happen in particular syllables, such as syllable-based syncope, or any change where the environment spans multiple syllables, such as umlaut.
Etymology is the study of the origin of words, for example the modern English word "today" from the on-line etymological dictionary
O.E. todæge, to dæge "on (the) day," from to "at, on" (see to) + dæge, dative of dæg "day." Generally written as two words until 16c., after which it usually was written to-day until early 20c. Similar constructions exist in other Gmc. languages (cf. Du. van daag "from-day," Dan., Swed. i dag "in day"). Ger. heute is from O.H.G. hiutu, from P.Gmc. *hiu tagu "on (this) day," with first element from PIE pronomial stem *ki-, represented by L. cis "on this side." 
It might not be too far to say that some words in a conlang will not have an etymology, but doubtless most will.
All of the words in esperanto are taken from another language, so all of them will share most of their etymology with the root. so "kiso" comes from the english "kiss", and shares the rest of that words etymology.
In another conlang, Jorayn, the word "dufadufath", meaning "deer" has the etymology that follows
"Imitative of the sound made by a deer's feet as they fall upon the freshly rained upon earth of the forest floor"
So the etymology might be more complex, such as that of Tolkien, who had the Quendian language family.
above is a chart tracing the etymology of the word for "people"
"kwendī" -> "pendi" -> "penni"
If you want to have full etymologies for you language it would be best to have it evolve from a proto-language. Following sound changes and lexical shifts along the way.
Grammar changes are when a part of the grammar of a language changes over time, so that the language now has a different way of accomplishing the same thing.
For example, when French evolved from Latin it did not have a fixed word order, while it now does; much information that in Latin was conveyed by use of case, is conveyed by word order in modern French.
Grammar changes may take place in a variety of ways:
If you look at any natural language you will quickly find that its grammar is not completely regular. Almost any language will have some words that don't fit in to the usual pattern. Adding irregularities to your conlang is a must if you want it to feel more 'naturalistic'.
Despite their name, most kinds of irregularities can be classed into groups.
"You should be familiar with sound changes from previous chapters (History and Common sound changes). This section aims to show how well-chosen sound changes can affect the regularity of a conlang."
This is probably the most common cause of irregularities. Sound changes cause irregularities by changing a word differently depending on what form it is in. For example, if you have a noun ono and its plural is formed by suffixing a t to the end then you have a perfectly regular relationship.
However, if you make a sound change rule which states that o becomes u at the end of a word, then the relationship is no longer so obvious because the o changes into a u in the singular but doesn't in the plural because the o is no longer at the end of the word. 
Using the right sound changes for your conlang is a good way of adding irregularity to it.
Suppletion is a slightly rarer phenomenon so if you decide to use it in your conlang then you should do so sparingly. But, of course, before you can use it, you need to know what it is:
Suppletion is when a completely separate word replaces one part of a paradigm. For example, the English word "went" is completely unrelated (etymologically speaking) to "go". "Went" is actually the past tense of a mostly forgotten verb "wend" which means more or less the same thing as "go". Because the verbs came to mean roughly the same thing, most people stopped using "wend" and used "go" instead. However, the past tense of "wend" survived and was used as the past tense of "go".
Thus instead of the paradigm "go/goes", "is going", ""goed"" ("ging"), "has/have gone", we now have "go/goes", "is going", "went", "has/have gone". Suppletion also affected the English verb "to be" ("am/is/are", "am/is/are being", "was/were", "has/have been").
Most conlangs are designed to be at least somewhat naturalistic as they are often inspired by natlangs or intended to be used by concultures. They usually use grammar, phonemes, etc. that could easily exist in natural languages of today. However, there certainly isn't a rule requiring would-be conlangers to limit themselves to established possibilities in natlangs.
Thinking outside the conlanging box is hardly a crime and there is much room for experimentation. Just as artists in music and painting have pushed the envelope with atonality and dadaism while being told that their works were not art by critics, you can buck the trends of conlanging and take it in bold new directions.
Here are a few ideas to ponder:
Imagine that you go to another country. You can't speak this country's language, and so you grab a travel book with some common sentences. Let's say you go to France, and you see that the way you ask for the hotel is "S'il vous plaît, où est l'hôtel?". Try to say it. If you don't know how to read French, perhaps you are trying to read it as an English sentence. That's just not good, because you might read it something like "Sil vooze plate, ow ehst low-tel", which doesn't sound like the French sentence you wanted to say.
To prevent such things from happening, an alphabet was invented to represent the most common sounds in all languages on Earth, called the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA. In order to represent each sound by a single symbol, the designers of the IPA have created a great many new letters — upper- and lower-case Roman letters treated separately, modified versions of Roman letters that rotate them, flip them around, or add hooks, loops, or bars to them, Greek letters, and a few symbols that are partly or completely new. IPA is a very valuable tool for linguists, but there's also a downside to all those special symbols. They aren't easy to add into electronic documents — there isn't a key on a standard keyboard for, say, ɰ — and they're hard to display, too — with all those little details, they require higher resolution than ordinary text (that is, plain ASCII), and many computer programs can't display them at all. To get around these problems, people have invented various alternatives to IPA using standard ASCII characters (though of course these alternatives sometimes need more than one character to represent a single sound). For this book, we're going to use one such alternative designed by and for conlangers, called Conlang X-SAMPA, or CXS for short. (The "full" name, in case you're curious, is "Conlang Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet".)
There is a chart of CXS sound names available in the appendix. Don't worry, you don't need to know all these sounds right now; the next section will introduce you to some of the more common English ones. There are a few general patterns that may help make sense out of the overall arrangement of CXS. (Don't put yourself out trying to memorize these patterns; it should be enough later that you've been exposed to them now.) Most consonants start with a letter; if any additional symbols are needed, the additional symbols usually aren't letters, and if there is an additional letter it's preceded by an underscore, like "" or "". Most digits are used to represent vowels. The backslash, backquote, tilde, and semicolon symbols, "     ", are only used as modifiers after something else to form a different sound — though it will turn out that, of these, backquote, tilde, and semicolon modify the sound in uniform ways, while backslash usually means "something similar to", and occasionally is used to make a new symbol with no relation at all to the old one. The underscore symbol, "", is only used as a separator between other symbols within the representation of a single sound.
CXS is a handy single phonetic alphabet if you only get to learn one, and we won't expect you to learn any other phonetic alphabets for this book. But, that said, you'll also find IPA being used routinely by conlangers in finished documents (like slide presentations, or language descriptions made to be printable on paper); so it will probably pay off for you to become somewhat familiar with IPA as well. To help you along with that, we've set up a chart showing both IPA and CXS together, for comparison.
You may have noticed during the Beginner lesson on sounds that there was some trouble distinguishing between the sounds that we say and the words that we write. To solve this problem linguists tend to write sounds — that are spoken — between a pair of forward-slashes (//) and letters — that are written — between angle brackets ( >).
For example, the English word ship is written  and pronounced // (in CXS, or in IPA).
All spoken languages use systems of sounds (called a phonology), and most of these aren't anything like English, including, hopefully, the conlang that you'll soon have. This section should help you.
The parts of this section are:
Phones are every possible sound that the human mouth can make. As well as the "regular" sounds of language, this includes hissing through your teeth, smacking your lips, and waggling your tongue. There are thousands of possible phones.
The phones that occur in a language are usually divided up into two categories: phonemes and allophones. The difference between the two is sometimes summarised like this: "Allophones are what the speaker says, and phonemes are what the listener hears".
Phonemes are the individual sounds that makes up syllables in a language. For example, in the word "tin", there are three sounds:
So what's so special about a phoneme, you ask? Isn't it the same as a phone? Well no, some phones aren't phonemes. For example, if you cough, that's a sound that you're making with your mouth, but it's certainly not a phoneme, since it is not going to be a part of any English word that you're likely to speak. But languages don't usually have the same phonemes. If you smack your lips together, say, that's not a phoneme in the language you speak (English), but it is in some languages of southern Africa — they use this sound as part of their words. And depending on where you're from, you might roll your tongue in such basic words like "bird" and "hard", but this is actually one of the rarest phonemes to be found in all the languages of the world!
Here are more examples of English words split into phonemes:
"Note that we're talking about sounds here, not letters, so all the silent letters and irregular spellings are ignored. Furthermore, "x" is two sounds, "k" and "s", while "sh" is one sound — just "sh", not "s" and "h"."
So when you're conlanging, first consider this: what phonemes do you have? If you just make up words on the fly, eventually you're going to use up all of the phonemes of English (and no more), giving you a phonology that's precisely the same as English. To avoid this problem, it's much better to have an idea of the phonemes that you have, and make up words according to "those". This way you can have a language that sounds like itself, and not like English.
Say "ssss" to yourself, "s" as in "snake" or "soon". You'll notice that the sound is coming from the tip of your tongue, which is resting flat against the roof of your mouth. Now, while still hissing to yourself, vary it a bit; move it forwards and backwards; perhaps lower your tongue and raise it again. You may notice that as long as you don't go too far, it still sounds like "s" to you — even though it may sound a bit different, it's still the same basic sound.
That's what "allophone" means. As long as you're within reasonable bounds, you can make a lot of sounds that are a little different from each other, but they're still the same basic sound, or phoneme. Those individual variations are allophones.
Now, why is this important? Well, what are allophones in one language may not be in another. The different "s"s that you pronounced just now may sound the same to you, but they are considered as two or more different phonemes in Basque, a language of northern Spain. If you were speaking Basque, you'd have to distinguish a "sharp s" and a "regular s" — sounds that may sound exactly the same to you! Tonal languages go even further — in Chinese, the syllable "ma" can change into the word for "mother", "horse", "scold", and even "hemp" (yeah that's right) depending on the tone that you "sing" it with. Again, to the untrained ear, these sound almost exactly the same. On the other hand, the words "beet" and "bit" may sound very different to you, but in many languages, the "ee" and "ih" sounds sound like the exact same phoneme. This is why people all over the world, from France to China to Japan to Brazil, all end up pronouncing English "this" as "zees". (The "z" is another case in point — the "th" and "z" sounds sound different to you, but they are likely to sound the same to a non-English speaker.)
So when you're conlanging, remember that if you're including new sounds that don't exist in the English language, those are going to sound pretty confusing (even to yourself) for a while. That's okay — it simply means that you're an English speaker, attuned to the sounds of English, not your conlang (yet). Trust that the conpeople speaking your conlang are not going to have trouble with sounds that you yourself cannot tell apart or even pronounce.
Sometimes allophones appear depending on environment. For example, the English sound // consists of two main allophones: [] and [] ("unaspirated" and "aspirated"). [] is pronounced with a small puff of air afterwards. Put your hand in front of your mouth and feel for the puff of air in the word "pat" (with an aspirated p). Then compare the airflow from the "p" in "spat" (unaspirated). While this distinction may seem almost unnoticeable to an English speaker, since they are allophones in English and our mind isn't in the mode to interpret them separately, there are languages where they are separate phonemes and are distinguished — Quechua, for example.
So if you have two sounds in a given language, how do you know whether they are different phonemes, or just allophones of the same phoneme? Well, one way is to find a "minimal pair". A minimal pair is a pair of two words that are exactly the same except for the sound in question. For example, "bat" and "pat" are pronounced the same except for the initial consonant. In English, a speaker can distinguish between the two words, so that means that // and // are separate phonemes word-initially. There are languages where "bat" and "pat" would sound the same to the speakers, and in those languages [] and [] probably are allophones. Similarly, in English [] and [] do not form any minimal pairs, but in Quechua, they do.
In the Sound notation section we told you how linguists distinguish writing from speech by putting writing in  and sounds in /slashes/. We can now introduce you to the full system. It's actually phonemes (rather than just "sounds") that are written in /slashes/. To write allophones, linguists surround them with [square brackets].
In the Beginner section on sounds, we saw that sounds can be divided into two groups: consonants and vowels.
English — though, like all languages, it varies from dialect to dialect — usually contains about 25 consonants and 19 vowels (and not 21 consonants and 5 vowels as one might assume when looking at the alphabet). The average language has about three times as many consonants as vowels.
Different vowels can be described using two main criteria:
How high or low a vowel is. This is basically a fancy name for saying how wide you open your mouth to say it. Low vowels require opening wide, and high vowels don't. Just think of it as how "high" or "low" your jaw needs to be — the lower the jaw, the wider you need to open your mouth.
Some people call these "close" (for high), "mid" (for mid-height), and "open" (for low).
How front or back a vowel is. This is a bit harder to describe, but it's basically where the highest part of your tongue is — whether it's at the front of your mouth or the back of your mouth.
Tip: If you're having trouble grasping this concept, try putting a tootsie pop in your mouth and saying various vowels. You'll be more able to feel the height and frontness of the different sounds.
Vowels also have some other features which aren't as important as the ones above. All languages distinguish their vowels using both height and backness, but the following distinctions are optional; feel free to play around with them and perhaps, if you're feeling confident, include one in your conlang. We'll go into more detail about these in the Advanced level.
Consonants are sounds that are produced by constricting the airflow at one or more points along the vocal tract.
Just like vowels, consonants can vary in many ways.
The manner of articulation basically corresponds to how strong the consonants are and how much they disrupt the airflow from the lungs. The plosives are pronounced with the tongue (or other part of the lower jaw) touching the roof of the mouth. As consonants get weaker the gap between the top of the mouth and the bottom gets larger and the mouth lets the air through more directly.
The place of articulation — Like the vowels, consonants differ depending on how far forward or back they are. Different parts of the mouth are used for different positions. For example, the lips are used to make some of the more frontal consonants while the palate is further back. This part is complicated because some sounds use a combination of the features (for example "w" uses both the lips and the back of the mouth).
Labial consonants are the furthest forward, and are pronounced using the lips. A little further back we have the coronal consonants which are pronounced using the teeth or the alveolar ridge (a "bump" just behind the teeth). Dorsal consonants are at the back of the mouth and are pronounced using the hard palate (middle roof of the mouth) or the velum (or soft palate: back roof of the mouth).
It's important to understand that labial, coronal, and dorsal are all groups of articulations that can be subdivided into more precise terms. For example — Coronal can be subdivided into "dental", "alveolar", and "retroflex". We don't expect you to understand all these subdivisions here at the Intermediate level, but you should be aware that they exist.
Place the palm of your hand against the base of your neck just below your adam's apple and start pronouncing the // sound, the first sound in the word . Try to draw the sound out for a few seconds, as though you were saying "ffffff". Now do the same with the // sound as in , "vvvvvv". You should immediately feel a vibration in your throat when you say // that doesn't occur when you say //. This vibration is called "voicing" and the thing inside your throat that is vibrating is called your "vocal cords".
The consonants that are pronounced together with this vibration are called "voiced" consonants. Those consonants that do not vibrate the vocal cords are called "unvoiced".
Most languages make use of both voiced and unvoiced consonants, but there are plenty that do not. If you decide that your conlang doesn't care about voicing then you should use the unvoiced letters when you're describing the sounds of your language. If you're feeling particularly adventurous then you may want to research a concept related to voicing called "aspiration" which you can think of as a kind of "super-unvoiced" or "whispered" form that some consonants can have.
If you experiment with the hand-on-throat trick a little you may discover that voicing also applies to vowels. All vowels in English have that same vibration as voiced consonants. Unvoiced vowels do exist but they're pretty rare because they can be difficult to hear accurately.
Terms for describing consonants aren't neatly divided into the basic terms given above and esoteric terms that clearly belong at the Advanced level. There are a lot of middling-difficult terms. You don't really need them for the rest of the Intermediate level of this book (once we're off this page, Intermediate Phones); but in discussions of conlanging, it's likely that one or another of them will come up from time to time. To keep your head above water when following such discussions, you don't need a detailed technical knowledge of all these terms, but it will help if you have some idea what they're about.
To start with, you can look over the row and column headings of the main table of consonant sounds in the CXS appendix. The column headings name many more precise places of articulation than just the three we've mentioned (labial, coronal, and dorsal), and the row headings name several more manners of articulation.
Here are some other terms that may be useful to have some clue about, and clues to a few of the more opaque of those row and column headings.
There is some order to this welter of sounds, and it's called the sonority hierarchy. It arranges all the different kinds of consonants and vowels into a single scale according to, essentially, how free the airflow is, unifying the properties of consonant "strength" and vowel "height". At one end of the scale are the strongest consonants, and then increasingly weak consonants until the weakest consonants give way to the high vowels; at the far end of the scale are the low vowels.
Here is a typical version of the hierarchy. Not everyone agrees on some details of the ordering. Note that the term "sonorant" defies the vowel/consonant distinction, as it includes both all the vowels and some of the weaker consonants. The table goes from most sonorous at the top to least sonorous at the bottom.
Phonemes don't just randomly combine to make a language. They have to be arranged according to certain rules. For example, if you take the phonemes out of "complexity" and rearrange these randomly, you don't get an English word:
So what is phonotactics? Basically, it tells you what sounds can go where, and what sounds can't. In English, for example, a word can begin with spl- (split, splash), and spr- (spray, spread), but not slr- or srl-, or slp- or srp-. That's just how it works in English. On the other hand, words in Russian can begin with vstr- and dn-, which you wouldn't be seeing any time soon in English. Words in Japanese, on the other hand, can't begin with spr- or spl- or even sp-; it has to begin with a single consonant, or none at all. (When Japanese people pronounce "splash", they tend to say "suh-puh-la-shuh" // — For comparison, try pronouncing the Ukrainian city of "Dnipropetrovs'k".)
So how would you make these constraints up for your conlang? Well, the earlier section on syllables can help. Start by dividing your conlang's phonemes into different categories and then defining which categories can combine with others in what ways inside a syllable.
For instance, Toki Pona defines its allowed syllables as V or CV(n), where C is any consonant and V is any vowel; "n" represents itself //; and the parentheses mean "optional". So syllables like // and // are allowed in Toki Pona, but // and // are not. Konya allows C(S)V(N), where S is a semivowel (// or //) and N is a nasal (// or //). Vorlin allowed syllables of the form CVC, where C is any consonant in Vorlin except // and C is any consonant in Vorlin except //.
English itself does not have simple phonotactics. It allows (C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)(C). "Strengths" for example is one of the longest allowed syllables even though it doesn't fully use up the allowed coda. But there are still constraints on what consonant clusters are allowed in the onset and coda.
How would you create your own syllable structure? By selecting what sounds can occur in the onset, nucleus, and coda of a syllable (remember back to the section on syllables). You will notice that all the examples above have V (any vowel) as their nucleus and that it's never in brackets (and thus not optional).
Another way to specify phonotactics is to make a list of all consonant clusters that are allowed and then, by implication, you should know which consonant clusters can't appear in your language. For example, in the conlang Quenya, the consonant clusters //, //, and // are allowed, but the consonant clusters //, //, and // aren't.
Of course, these two ways to describe phonotactics are not mutually exclusive; one can perfectly state that, given the restrictions of syllabical structure, there are certain clusters that don't happen and other that do.

Sandhi is the general name for a number of effects in which sound changes at the boundaries between morphemes (the minimal units of meaning in language, like the in-, describe, and -able mentioned earlier), depending on the sound or grammatical function of neighboring morphemes. The word sandhi is from the Sanskrit संधि, "joining".
There are two forms of sandhi. "Internal sandhi" is what happens when two morphemes join together and the sounds in those morphemes affect each other in some way. An example of internal sandhi would be the change of // to // in the word  which comes from the Greek roots  and .
"External sandhi" is a change that happens at a word boundary rather than inside a single word. All languages will do this to some extent, but it is often not reflected in that language's writing:  is usually pronounced as // in fast speech and features the same // to // change as with .
The word ‘sandhi’ is a term originally used to refer to a set of Sanskrit phonological processes, such as how certain combinations of vowels happen to change when they meet at morpheme boundaries:  +  → , ‘friendly instruction’.
So it's all very well to say that sounds change when they meet, but we still need to understand how they change. What kinds of transformations can occur? What patterns are there?
Perhaps the most frequent form of sandhi that languages have is called "assimilation". Assimilation happens when two different sounds come together and one of the sounds changes to become more like the other. We've already seen an example of this in the word  where the // in  changed its place of articulation from dorsal to labial to match the labial consonant // at the beginning of .
Similarly the word  is itself an example of assimilation. It comes from the Latin roots  and . The // changes its manner of articulation to become a fricative and it also changes its voicing to become unvoiced. These are both properties that // has, and it so happens that an unvoiced dorsal fricative is // meaning that the assimilation is so complete that the // is completely swallowed up by the // and the only remnant left is a doubled  in the written form of the word.
Another common form of sandhi is lenition, which means ‘softening’. Lenition usually occurs to consonants when they get surrounded by vowels. If you can remember back to the sonority hierarchy, you might remember that vowels are more sonorous than consonants and you can think of lenition as consonants assimilating to the higher sonority of the vowel that they are now butting up against.
Lenition can be broken down into several more specific processes where certain specific kinds of consonants undergo certain kinds of changes:
No matter the specific details, all of these involve taking a consonant from lower down on the sonority hierarchy and moving it a little further up.
The opposite of lenition is "fortition". While less common, it does occur; as in the Italian // ‘house, home’ → [] but // ‘at home’ → [].
In tonal language the tones will often interact via a process called "tone sandhi", where one of the tones will become another under certain situations, often under the influence of other tones. 
Here a few examples from modern Chinese (mandarin, pinyin writing system) :
When any number of tone 3 syllables directly proceed a tone three syllable the first syllables will change to a tone 2.
In a string of three syllables, where a tone 2 in preceded by either tone 1 or 2, and followed by any tone but the neutral tone, the second syllable will become tone 1.
Another language exhibiting complex tone sandhi is Amoy.
Quoted from Wikipedia : Tone sandhi 
"Amoy has five tones, which are reduced to two in syllables which end in a stop consonant. (These are numbered 4 and 8 in the diagram above.) Within a phonological word, all syllables but the last one change tone. Among unstopped syllables (that is, those which do not end in a stop), tone 1 becomes 7, tone 7 becomes 3, tone 3 becomes 2, and tone 2 becomes 1. Tone 5 becomes 7 or 3, depending on dialect. Stopped syllables ending in //, //, or // take the opposite tone (phonetically, a high tone becomes low, and a low tone becomes high), whereas syllables ending in a glottal stop (written h in the diagram above) drop their final consonant to become tones 2 or 3."
Syllables are the basic unit of sound that you can sound out. This is because they have a "peak" — something that you can draw out. For example, the one-syllable word  has a peak that you can draw out (the sound of the "a", //). This drawn out sound is usually a vowel in English, but some consonants can also take up the role; American English often has no vowel in the last syllable of words like  and , the final // acts as a syllable all by itself.
It's probably of no surprise that people all around the world use the syllable as a fundamental unit in both poetry and song:
Syllables aren't just a jumble of sounds that happen to have a peak. As we have already seen, only some phonemes can be the peak in any given language. This is called the nucleus of the syllable. Everything in the syllable that comes before the nucleus is called the onset and everything after it is called the coda. For example, let's take the English one syllable word  and determine its nucleus, onset, and coda. First break the word down into its component phonemes.
Now the nucleus of the syllable must be the vowel, //; the onset is everything before that, //; and the coda must be //. Syllables don't have to have an onset or a coda, so that the nucleus could be the whole syllable.
In most languages, you will find that certain syllables inside a word are "stressed" more than others. This is something you will need to consider for your conlang. English stress is mostly unpredictable, and isn't indicated anywhere in the orthography. When you create your own language, however, you will need either rules of stress that are absolutely regular or a simple way of indicating it when you write your language down.
How should stress be determined? There are many ways you can do that. A very simple way would be to always place stress on a specific syllable: Esperanto, for example, always stresses the penultimate. Another idea is to stress different syllables depending on the phonemes each syllable uses: Latin stresses the penultimate except when both final syllables have short vowels that have no more than a single consonant between them.
The possibilities don't stop there, either. Perhaps stress could be based on the relative "weight" of different phonemes in different places, such as in Spanish: stress the last syllable if that syllable ends with a consonant (except "n", "s"), unless noted otherwise in the orthography. Or you could get rid of the stress distinction altogether, as French has, and instead stress certain "words" more than others. (French actually stresses the last syllable of phrases, rather than individual words.)
Finally, you could always try using tone instead of stress, but unless your native language is tonal as well you could have a lot of difficulty here. A tonal language distinguishes syllables based on their pitch; for example "high pitch," "extra-low pitch," "low rising pitch" (which starts low before gradually rising), and various others. You can even have "high rising," "rising-falling," or "creaky voice" — in which case the tone is so low the individual vibrations of the vocal chords can be heard. We'd recommend you to examine one or more tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese or Vietnamese, and discern the ways those languages make use of it before trying it yourself.
Of course, all of the above refers merely to the stress and tone of individual syllables within a word; if your language isn't tonal, you should also consider the use of stress over entire sentences, though you needn't make it very complicated. English, for example, tends to stress nouns and verbs over prepositions, except when making a point. It also tends to add a slightly higher tone at the end of questions than in statements. (As seen in "This is a sentence" versus "This is a "sentence"?") You can ignore this sort of thing altogether, or you can make rules of your own.
Scripts, or writing systems, are one of the first things many people notice when they come in contact with another language. Many people, at some point in their life, have tried making some sort of "code", with a one-to-one correspondence between their symbols and their native language's letters. Read on to learn how to make a realistic script for a language.
There are 5 main types of scripts. This page lists them in order from most to least advanced. The less advanced the system is, the harder it is to learn and change: 
Ideographic systems use one symbol for one thought or idea. Since languages aren't made up directly of thoughts and ideas, and writing systems represent language, true ideographic systems do not exist. They will be covered for the purposes of "alien" languages, though. Chinese is often described as "ideographic" -- this is either just a loose use of the term to mean "logographic", or it is a misunderstanding -- Chinese characters do not represent ideas directly. Japanese kanji come closer to the "ideographic" ideal, with one symbol representing any of several synonyms in context.
Alphabets are the dominant writing system in use in Europe and areas formerly colonized by Europe. Basically, they represent one symbol per sound, including vowel sounds.
All too often, however, alphabets, especially the Latin alphabet, are more complex. Each symbol often represents more than one sound, sometimes distinguished in the language, sometimes not. For example, English  represents /k/ and /s/,  /ks/ and /gz/ (as in exist), or /a/, /A/, /{/, /O/, or /@/. The main reason for this is that the Latin alphabet was made for Latin and simply adapted for later languages. English itself had originally used a runic script, as did the Scandinavian languages. Latin written in the Latin script is entirely phonetic. 
Many alphabets also have combinations of letters representing a completely different sound. These are called "digraphs". In English, the main consonant digraphs are  /S/,  /tS/, and  /N/, plus many others. "Diphthongs", or vowel-combinations, also occur often. English  represents /aj/ as well as /i/ or /I/. Some languages make use of digraphs for diphthongs, such as  for /ej/.
Note that situations like the above happen very often. As languages change, their orthography (writing system) may adapt, but not always grow to match it. Almost never does a language have letters that represent only one sound but no others. A realistic con-script should not have a direct correspondence between English and itself as well.
Diacritics are another method alphabets may use. Creating new symbols can be difficult and hard to remember, so many languages created "diacritics", or small, additional strokes, to letters to mark new sounds. The main diacritics used in Latin script languages are the acute: ' (á,é, etc., and usually mark stress), the grave (à, è, etc.), the circumflex (â, ê), the diaeresis (ä, ë), the tilde (ã, ñ, usually marking nasalization on vowels), the cedilla (ç), and many others. "Ligatures", or combinations of letters, may also be brought in, such as "æ". The symbol "                                               and , making "et", the Latin word for "and".
Some languages, though, do make new letters, which are often based on previous systems. Examples include the "þ" (thorn, /T/), which was derived from a rune (ᚦ) and "ð" (eth, /D/), developed in the Middle Ages, which are used in Icelandic, Old English, and several related languages.
Some letters may not make a sound themselves, but do affect other letters. For example, the Cyrillic  Ь> (soft sign) palatalizes the consonant before it. Some letters can perform both a function and a sound, such as the Russian  Я> ("ya"), which both palatalizes the previous consonant and is pronounced /a/.
There are a few scripts termed featural which tend to be similar to alphabets but show phonemic features rather than phonemes themselves. The best example is undoubtedly Korean hangeul, though featural elements also occur in a few other scripts, such as Japanese hiragana and katakana, which are mostly syllabaries but take diacritics to indicate voicing.
Abjads are the main writing system of the Middle East. Basically, they mark consonants in an alphabetic fashion, but vowels are not typically marked.
The Arabic and Hebrew abjads are entirely composed of consonants. Vowels can be marked, but generally aren't. Arabic has six vowel marks. Three of them, the 'short vowels', are only marked with diacritics. The other three, the 'long vowels', share symbols with some of the consonants. /a/ shares 'alif /?/, /i/ shares yaa /j/, and /u/ shares waaw /w/. When they are treated as consonants or as vowels can be more clearly seen when vowels are shown.
Arabic has an additional diacritic called the "sukuun", meaning the letter it is placed over does not have a vowel over it. If the sukuun is placed over 'alif, yaa, or waaw, they function as consonants. If there is no sukuun, but instead a vowel marker, they become long vowels. They can also become diphthongs if they have a sukuun, but the previous consonant has a vowel. So, the following form is pronounced /kaj/:
Ø a
Y K
(where Ø is the sukuun, and remember that Arabic is read from right to left).
Since vowels aren't usually marked, pronunciation has to be inferred by context. The sequence "KY" (using English order) can be pronounced:
/ kaja kajI kajV kIja kIjI kIjV kVja kVjI kVjV kaj /
Abugidas are the main writing system of India, other South Asian countries, and South-East Asia. They are basically a group of syllables with a common inherent vowel, which has to be changed with diacritics.
All syllables start out with an inherent vowel, usually /a/, and a different consonant: ka, ca, ta, ta, pa, etc. These each have their own symbol. So, say you want to make the syllable . The  diacritic is then added to the  symbol, and negates the /a/. Note that in the Indian and South-East Asian languages diacritics can come before and after a letter instead of only above or below.
Hindi has diacritics for all of its vowels and diphthongs - a, e, i, o, u, r, ai, and au. But what if a word or syllable begins with a vowel? There are two ways you could potentially handle this. In most of the abugidas of Asia, there is a set of "independent vowels", which are full letters just like any of the other consonants, and their purpose is only for syllable-initial vowels.
The other way is not done in any of the South Asian abugidas, but still doable. Just make a "vowel carrier", a letter that makes no sound, but can carry vowel diacritics, like the Hebrew aleph.
Many of these abugidas also contain "Conjunct Consonants", which you don't have to do too. These are basically ligatures, where the form of two letters are combined into one "space", and they together can take a vowel. For example, when "ta" and "ka" are combined, they become "tka", which can take diacritics like any other consonant.
Syllabaries are spread around the world in use. They contain separate symbols for every CV (consonant + vowel) combination in the language, although final consonants have many ways of being done.
Here is an example of a typical syllabary, romanized. This is the Cree system:
Note that there are also symbols for the vowels alone. To make final consonants (of the CVC form), the last row of symbols, called the "Finals", are added. So, "tak" would be written with two symbols:  and . Many syllabaries use this method, and it is basically limited to languages with a small number of legal final consonants.
Another system for finals, used by the Mayan syllabary system, is the "Principle of Synharmony". This states that a final vowel is marked by reduplicating the previous vowel. For example, a word like "kalo" is done with two symbols, as usual: ka-lo. But, if you want the syllable "kal", the previous vowel is repeated: ka-la. Since the vowel was repeated, it is ignored on the second syllable. This applies for any vowel. But what if you want to make the syllable "kala"? That requires three syllables, adding in a simple vowel: ka-la-a. The second "a" is negated, but returned by the next syllable.
A third system, used by Hittite, comprised of two sets of syllables, one set in CV form, and another set in VC form. This way, when a syllable of the form CVC was needed, one would write CV-VC, for instance,  for "kal". Additionally, when the vowel in question needed to be made long, like "kāl", the pattern became CV-V-VC: . For "kala" one would simply write  as the /l/ would move onto the next syllable.
Sometimes, though not always, syllables with a relation, such as the same consonant, look similar. For example, the syllables "ka", "ke", "ki", etc., may look similar. In systems such as in Ojibwe, the vowel signs are changed by simply rotating the symbol around.
And many more systems.
There is a set of scripts from pre-Roman Spain that sit in an intermediate category between true alphabets and syllabaries. In those scripts, the plosives combine with the following vowels in a single syllabogram — for instance, there is a single symbol for PA, another for PI, another for PE, etc. — but all other consonants and vowels also have single symbols. In such a system, for example, the phrase "barenarkenti" would be spelled with the nine symbols         . In fact, it's likely that such systems evolved out of so-called "redundant alphabets", where the stops had separate signs depending on the vowel that followed them, much like the ancient Etruscan alphabet, where the /k/ sound was written  before ,  before  or , and  before  (the Etruscan language lacked an /o/ sound).
Logographic systems are/were used to write Chinese, Japanese, ancient Egyptian, Mayan, Sumerian, and many other languages. Ancient civilizations created logography first, and then evolved them into other systems.
In a logographic system, each symbol represents a morpheme, or the smallest meaningful part of language. For example, "hand", "red", "place", "-er", "-ist", "un-" and "anti-" are all morphemes. In a logographic system, each of these would get its own symbol. As you can probably imagine, there are thousands of morphemes in most languages, and hence thousands of symbols exist in any logographic system.
However, these symbols are not all random. In general, symbols of words that represent visible ideas or things are often little drawings. (Remember though that writing constantly develops, so after a few thousand years, there wouldn't be too much resemblance left!) For example, words like "sun", "moon", "man", "child", "water", "fire", "left", "right", "dog", "horse", "tree", "flower", etc. are likely to be drawn as pictures.
Not all words can be drawn this way, though. How are you going to draw "love", or "-er", or "anti-"? Different languages had different approaches. In some cases a word with a similar pronunciation is substituted, for example, writing "ant" to mean "anti-". If you do this often enough, you're on your way to a syllabary, an abugida, or an abjad. In some cases however, another picture is drawn to "explain" the new word: for example, you might draw a spear next to "ant" to mean "anti-" -- spear means you're opposed, right? In ancient Egyptian, the spear would be set aside as a separate symbol, while in Chinese the spear would be incorporated into the "ant" symbol to make a new symbol for "anti-". (This is why scripts like Egyptian are sometimes called logophonetic, a name also applied to languages using a mix of logographs and some other system.) The choice here is really up to you.
In fact, it is estimated that 90%+ of Chinese characters are formed using the above method: taking an existing symbol with a similar pronunciation, and incorporating another symbol to explain the meaning. Over time, however, these characters' shapes have fossilized, and a lot of sound and meaning changes occur, so some characters are made up of symbols that really don't represent their meanings or sounds very well any more.
Now, if you have decided what kind of writing system you want, there are three more steps left to take: Writing Direction, Script History, and Mediums of Writing. Then you can get on to the actual script-making.
All scripts have a certain writing direction. Latin writes from left-to-right. Hebrew and Arabic write from right-to-left. Mongolian is top-to-bottom. These are the main types of directions accounted for in real Earth scripts:
"Boustrophedon" is where on one line a text is read left-to-right, on the next right-to-left, on the next left-to-right again, and so forth.
Note that in Ancient Greek, a Boustrophedon language, sometimes the letters would literally be flipped over when reading in the other direction. So, for example, the Greek letter  ('digamma') would be  when read left-to-right, but the prongs would face left when reading right-to-left.
If you would like to stick with one of the above methods, go ahead. Most scripts use them. A few more complex systems are described below:
Some scripts can be written in many directions, that is, left-to-right, right-to-left, and top-to-bottom are all acceptable. Chinese and Ancient Egyptian do/did this. In Ancient Egyptian, all of the hieroglyphs with a face would face toward the direction in which to start reading. So, if you were reading right-to-left, all of the hieroglyphs that had a face (or a discernible front side) would 'face' right. In Chinese, it must be determined by context.
Another system is the "Rotational" system, a very rare one. As far as I know, only one script ever used it, Rongorongo (the Easter Island script). It is similar to boustrophedon, except that the letters also rotate 180 degrees after each line! If you rotate the reading board around after each line, they would look normal. Here is an example of this using English letters:
Some other ideas that (so far) have not been used:
Scripts are not static. They change constantly, just as language does. Compare writing like Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and modern Latin script. Believe it or not, modern Latin script ultimately derives from "Proto-Sinaitic", a small collection of Egyptian hieroglyphs. These hieroglyphs were later adopted into Phoenician, where they were drastically simplified and each assigned a single sound. Through heavy contact with the Phoenicians, soon the Greeks adopted their alphabet, but changed some of their consonant letters, representing sounds that don't exist in Greek, into the Greek vowel signs. Sometime, though we're not entirely sure why, Greek started being written in boustrophedon instead of right-to-left, and then ultimately stuck with left-to-right. When this switch occurred, all of the letters were 'flipped' over horizontally, giving the modern-day Greek alphabet. Then the Etruscans and Latins in the Italian peninsula adopted the Greek alphabet with minor modifications, the Latin one ultimately becoming the script now used throughout most of Europe. Cyrillic script also came from Greek, after the Russians' conversion to Orthodox Christianity, and after about 1,000 years of change, the modern Cyrillic alphabet came to be.
In Proto-Sinaitic and Phoenician the letter stood for the glottal stop /?/, but Greek lacked this sound, so it became /a/.
"A" originally started out as 'aleph, the ox. Later the body disappeared, leaving only the head. Then the head was simplified to a simple line, leaving the most distinctive parts (the horns) intact. Eventually the horns pierced the line, and the letter flipped on its side in Phoenician. In Greek, it was flipped again, and after several lines were trimmed down, it became the modern Latin/Greek/Cyrillic "A".
Note the change of complexity. Early writing is almost guaranteed to be some sort of picture-writing like hieroglyphics, where each symbol represents exactly what it looks like. But, as time goes on and writing spreads, for many this just became pointless complexity. The symbols start to simplify and sometimes turn into alphabets. When one literate people start to trade with an illiterate one, their writing system has a very good opportunity to spread. Sometimes one script wins over another. For example, in ancient India, there were two main scripts used: Brahmi and Kharosthi, but Kharosthi fell out of use and now all of the major scripts of India and parts of South-East Asia are descended from it.
Sometimes the early pictographic systems never simplify that much. In the Ancient Chinese writing, the characters did change, but many did not simplify as significantly as the Proto-Sinaitic ones. The modern Chinese logographic system is still very complex. The major reform in 1949 was instituted by the Chinese government.
One thing to note is the diversity of scripts in Europe compared to South-East Asia. Almost all of Europe uses Latin script or Cyrillic script, but in South-East Asia every country has at least one of its own scripts. This was probably because of the Roman Empire. The Romans unified most of Europe and had their script well established before they fell, and their script stayed. Such an empire did not exist in South-East Asia, leading to the vast diversity of scripts.
So, basically, the ancient hieroglyphic systems simplify when they are no longer only for priestly use, and therefore can be abbreviated. For the common person, carefully elaborating each symbol is just a major waste of time. This is still true today, to a lesser extent, but that is where cursive came from. Even the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs had heavily-reduced forms, known as "Demotic", and this was used by the common person. You can see demotic, for example, in the middle section of the Rosetta Stone . (Warning: Very big image)
Here is a good chart showing the evolution of a single symbol through the South-East Asian languages: 
The surface upon which a script is written actually does influence the script a great deal. When carved into stone, such as in the Fuþark or Runic scripts, the letters tend to be very angular and composed of straight lines. Curves are harder to do in stone than on paper. Also, despite being carved on stone in the Rosetta Stone, the Egyptian Demotic script is much more 'fluid' than the hieroglyphs, and it generally was written on papyrus.
The ancient Sumerians wrote on clay, using a reed stylus to impress symbols on it. This also gives it a very unique look. This type of writing is known as "Cuneiform".
Some modern languages, such as Burmese, retain their unique scripts from the past. The rounded shape of Burmese stems from the fact that it was originally written on palm leaves, which would tear if there were too many straight lines.
In the mixed-case systems of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts (meaning there is both an "upper-case" (majuscule) and a "lower-case" (minuscule)), the lower-case forms came from cursive versions of the capital letters.
Now, if you have thought about your script and chosen a script type, writing direction, and a medium, now you are ready to create your own script.
Conlanging, the art of creating a language, is a very in-depth, but fun, process. It is considered an art form by many. The people who conlang are called conlangers. Conlanging isn't just a hobby, though. You can learn a lot about how real languages work by creating conlangs and improving them.
"For a more exhaustive list, see the next chapter."
Since each kind of conlang has a different goal, each involves a different process of creation.
The most common conlangs are artlangs. Many conlangers create a con"world" to go with their conlang. They create a conrace, with a conculture. The process of creating a conworld is outlined in the Conworld wikibook.
The different types of conlangs will be discussed, with examples, in the next section.
This wikibook is designed to help you, the conlanger, create a fairly involved conlang. It will take you step-by-step through the process.
As you work through the steps outlined in this wikibook, you will probably have numerous questions. A good central place to find resources, including community resources like mailing lists and blogs, is the .
Step One is to create an alphabet, and come up with the sounds.
Example:
B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, SH, T, V, W, Y, and Z as in English. C as CH, DH as hard TH (this), J as French, TH as soft TH (thistle).
For vowels our language will have long and short vowels, short distinguished by two dots. Long vowels are as Spanish or Latin. Short for A, E, I, O, U are pat, bet, pig, paw, but. Vowel pairs are ai- my, au how, oi- boy.
For each module, the table of contents shows an icon indicating subjectively how complete that module is:
The module doesn't exist yet, or near enough.
Content and organization has yet to be fully decided.
The information is scattered, incomplete, or may be unreliable.
Much of the information is there, but it needs to be touched up or organised. This is still usable.
The information is essentially complete. However, additions and improvements can still be made.
Conlangs are classified into types and subtypes based mainly on why they are created. The three basic types are "enge"langs (engineered languages), "aux"langs (auxiliary languages), and "art"langs (artistic languages).
Whatever your reason for making a language, it's good to keep always in mind why you started it in the first place.
Engelangs, sometimes called englangs, are conlangs designed to meet objective criteria, rather than subjective goals like "elegance" or "ease of use". For example, one might design an engelang so that the arrangement of sounds in a word classifies its meaning; or so that its grammatical structure imitates formal logic; or so that its expressions conform to a certain ideology or point of view (say, Taoism, or feminism). Subjective goals are always around — motivating the choice of objective criteria, and filling in gaps in the language design that the objective criteria don't address. As long as the technical criteria take precedence when deciding features of the language design, it's an engelang.
Be aware (and beware) that the names for this type of conlang and its subtypes vary a bit across the conlanging community. What we're calling "engelangs" here, some conlangers call "loglangs" (a term we're using just for the ones that implement formal logic); and some other conlangers call them "philosophical languages" (a term we're using for a subtype of engelangs distinct from loglangs).
Loglangs are conlangs built around the structure of formal logic. They are usually designed to investigate how the human mind would work when using a language with that structure. Logical languages tend to have few or no irregularities and be similar in style to computer programming or markup languages. They advocate a logical and consistent architectural structure of utterances. Lojban, a language created to test the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis (the idea that language shapes the operation of the mind), is considered archetypal of the genre. Others are like Ithkuil, a language created by John Quijada: Ithkuil exists as an exercise in how human languages "could" function. These often overlap with philosophical languages.
Some examples of loglangs:
Philosophical languages are conlangs constructed to meet some philosophical goal. This goal can be to explore how the mind works by altering the fundamental structure of the language (which is the aim of some loglangs, such as Ithkuil), or it can be to see if language is even "possible" when certain elements are changed. In general, philosophical languages are experimental.
In some of them, for example, all the words for manmade objects (artifacts) will typically begin with the same letter, t for instance, all the words for pieces of furniture will begin with to-, the word for "chair" will be "tod", words for different types of chairs will begin with tod-, organisms will begin with v, plant species will begin with ve- while animals begin with vu-, all vertebrates will begin with vuz-, mammals with vuzu- and rodents with vuzum-. 
A common criticism of languages that use such a word categorization system is that the words that are most similar in meaning and topic, and will therefore most need to be distinguished from each other, will sound too alike, and become too confusable to learn, even though the goal of these languages is usually to make memorization easier. In a few of these languages a single phoneme or very short (two-letter) syllable will indicate an element of meaning, such as "light/vision", "female", or "many".
Some examples of philosophical languages:
Auxlangs are designed to help ease communication between two or more linguistically diverse communities. They use simple phonology and grammar to try to make them easy to learn. Their grammars are made in such a way as to express the widest range of meanings possible. There are many Auxlangs, and some of them were among the first constructed languages ever made.
Some examples of auxlangs:
Many auxlangs borrow their vocabulary entirely from the Indo-European languages — often from a mix of Romance and Germanic languages, but most often entirely from Romance languages. As a result, the vocabulary and general method of reaching the goal of universality sound a lot alike from auxlang to auxlang. These auxlangs are often called "Euroclones". More recent auxlangs that take their vocabulary from more diverse sources and use non-Indo-European grammar include Vorlin, , Ilomi, and SASXSEK.
Artlangs are created for a wide range of reasons: fleshing out works of fiction, fun, experimentation, or even historical study (colloquially called "if-langs"). Most people who create artlangs do so simply because they enjoy it. Several artlangs have gained high visibility in popular culture in recent years, such as Klingon, created for the Star Trek franchise by professional linguist Marc Okrand; the many Elvish languages, especially Quenya and Sindarin, in Tolkien's Middle-earth; and Dothraki, created by conlanger David J. Peterson for the "Game of Thrones" television series.
The most familiar and general subset of artlangs are fictional languages. These are spoken by the inhabitants of the fictional worlds of a book, movie, television show, video game, comic, or toy, such as Middle-earth, the Star Trek universe, or the game Myst. These worlds in which they are spoken are called conworlds, inhabited by fictional concultures. The conworld influences what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, foods, objects of technology (such as bricks, cannons, or telephones), sports, music genres, ethnic groups, religious concepts, and place names. 
The culture will also have an influence on some things like verb tenses (how your people view the future and the past, or whether time should even be grammatically indicated at all any more than place should), pronouns (whether the speakers need fine enough shades of "we" to distinguish the concept of "you and I" from "he and I", or whether they have different levels of formality for "you"), and how kinship terms are split up (some languages have different words for older and younger brothers, others do not distinguish "brother" from "sister", and some have different words for the sister of a sister and the sister of a brother). Tolkien started out inventing languages for his amusement and then retroengineered a fictional universe to have a world in which these languages would be spoken. 
Since the Internet became popular, many people have now become able to put up information on their conlangs and associated conworlds on their sites, and these have become famous. Verdurian, the language of Mark Rosenfelder's Verduria on the planet of Almea, is often invoked as a symbolic representative of these Net-based fictional languages.
Some examples of fictional languages:
Altlangs are also known as "What if?" languages or if-langs. They speculate on an alternate history and try to reconstruct how a family of natural languages would have evolved if things had been different. What if King Harold had won the Battle of Hastings? What if the Polynesians had settled in Central America during the time of Meso-American Empires? What if Alexander the Great had not been able to conquer Egypt? What if Greek civilization went on to thrive without a Roman Empire, leaving Greek and not Latin to develop several modern descendants? The language that "would have" evolved is then traced step by step in its evolution, to reach its final form.
The revered grandfather of this genre is Andrew Smith's Brithenig, which attempts to determine what Romance languages would have evolved into had the Romans displaced the Celtic people in Great Britain. The vocabulary of Latin is altered through the same evolution that befell Welsh from the evolution of the Celtic languages through the present day. An altlang will typically base itself on the core vocabulary of one language and the phonology of another. An altlang will ideally have meticulous understanding and admirable imagination as to world history, sturdy knowledge of linguistics, and ingenious improvising when it becomes necessary to "toss it up".
Some examples of altlangs:
Personal languages are languages that are created by and belong just to the inventor, for just the inventor to see, or perhaps to show off. A personal language is created for the ultimate purpose of creating a language. There is no conworld it is associated with, no people whom the creator actually expects to speak it, no product that will be manufactured in its language. A personal language is considered by many to be artlanging in its purest form, although a personal language may well have no artistic intention behind it. A personal language may be invented to create a beautiful language or for self-expression. It may be invented to give out a tribute to a language or language family the creator really likes, attempting to capture the flavor of the original as much as possible, or it may be created just for the fun that there is in creating a language.
Personal languages are often created as practices in linguistics; a conlanger learning about ergativity might write out the grammar of an ergative conlang in order to understand how ergative languages work. Some exist to test outlandish phonologies or orthographic systems, or have hundreds of noun cases or tens of millions of possible verb forms. Many are invented simply because people love constructing languages! The creators of personal languages often share their languages and update their progress over the Internet, and many habitually scrap an old conlang project that hasn't gotten beyond a lexicon of 50 words and start a new one. These personal languages tend to have short lifespans, but others are developed for years on end as their creators try to become truly fluent in them, perhaps using them for diaries and other writings.
Some artlangs are micronational languages — like fictional languages, but their creators make them real. They declare territory, issue official flags and currency, and recruit citizens, then have the citizens learn the language. These are the languages of micronations, sometimes created for entertainment, but often breakaway nations that are created for political purposes, declaring themselves to exist alongside UN-recognized nations (such as Sealand, the Conch Republic, or Atlantium). The members of these micronations meet up and speak the language they have learned when they are participating in these meets. The language and its creation belong to all the citizens of these micronations. They determine the direction of its evolution, invent new grammatical constructions when they discover it is necessary, and coin new words as they speak.
Some examples of micronational languages:
The three broad kinds of goals we've described — technical features, cross-cultural communication, and art — aren't mutually exclusive. What if your goal is to see whether a certain technical goal can be successfully combined with your personal aesthetics? Is that an engelang or an artlang? Liva is a conlang with just that sort of goals, and its author has suggested that conlangs should be placed on the interior of a triangle, with the three pure types of conlangs at its corners (see here).
Even if a conlang has a single, pure primary goal, there are enough details in any conlang that the primary goal probably doesn't cover all of them. Auxlangs have some artistry in their making — it's been argued that artistic merit is part of why Esperanto has succeeded so much better than its competitors. Engelangs may have some artistry in them, too; and artlangs often have some technical aspirations lurking under the surface.
A particular class of mixed-goal conlangs with its own name is the fauxlangs, short for fictional auxlangs. These are supposed auxlangs created by characters in a fictional setting, often in an alternative history. Examples include
A relex is a conlang generated from a pre-existing language by replacing the forms of the words, while leaving most of the rest of the original language unchanged — especially,
With both of these unchanged, the conlang is a sort of word-replacement code for the original language. By extension, "relex" is sometimes used as a broad criticism of any conlang seen as too closely copying another language.
The largest class of relexes are (by reputation, at least) artlangs whose authors failed to notice that they were copying most of the look and feel of their native language. Not all relexes are artlangs, though, and not all are unintentional. Auxlangs Speedwords and Glosa have both been criticized as relexes of English. The loglang started as a deliberate relex of , since which their grammars and vocabularies have gradually diverged as both languages underwent further development (see here).
Some relexes may be used for specific purposes. For example, the Israeli military uses a relex of Hebrew called "NADBAR".
The conlanging term "relex" is a shortening of the term "relexification", borrowed and adapted from linguistics proper. The linguistic term has a narrower meaning: in linguistic , a pre-existing language keeps its grammar but replaces its vocabulary from another pre-existing language. The language from which the vocabulary is taken is called the "lexifier".
Particular features of a conlang can be a posteriori — meaning borrowed from natural languages, rather than invented — or a priori, meaning invented rather than borrowed from natural languages. These terms are most often used to describe the forms of words, as with the words "toki", from the English word "talk", and "pona", from Latin "bona" (good). An entire conlang may also be described as a priori/posteriori if most of its grammar and vocabulary are of that type. A conlang described as a posteriori usually borrows from several, or even many, different natlangs; relexes are not normally called a posteriori.
Classification-based vocabulary is an a priori strategy that has been used in a number of engelangs (e.g., ) and some auxlangs (e.g., ). Most auxlangs make extensive use of a posteriori vocabulary.
A diachronic conlang is equipped with an internal, i.e., fictional, linguistic history. Since the internal history is fictional, all diachronic conlangs are artlangs; but most subtypes of artlangs include both diachronic and non-diachronic ("synchronic") languages.
Tolkien's Elvish languages are the most famous example of diachronic conlanging, with an entire family of languages descended from a common ancestor, . Many artlangs, though by no means all, have at least some suggestions of internal history about them, even if no parent language has been fully worked out.
Altlangs are diachronic, by definition.
A kitchen sink conlang is one that has way too many exotic features, all at once for no apparent reason — "everything including the kitchen sink" in an uncoordinated mishmash. Unlike "relex", "kitchen sink" has no neutral technical sense; it's always a strong term of opprobrium.
Kitchen sink languages are at the opposite end of a spectrum from relexes: where too little tinkering can produce a relex (that lacks interest), too much tinkering can produce a kitchen sink language (that lacks plausibility). It has been suggested that a conlanger's second conlang — after they've made a relex for their first — is often a kitchen sink language; but even experienced conlangers, tempted by the lure of exotic features, can sometimes fall into the trap of kitchen-sink-ism. 
Caution should also be exercised, though, in "applying" the term "kitchen sink" to a conlang — not only because it's such a strong term, but because just having many unusual features doesn't "necessarily" make it a kitchen sink language (which is why the term is so strong). For proper use of the term, the many unusual features should be unjustified; in principle, at least, it's possible for many unusual features to occur in a smoothly coherent design, so that they all feel quite natural in context. The catch is that — as David Peterson remarked when awarding the 2007 Smiley Award to , a highly respected conlang with several unusual features — there is a double standard at work between natlangs and conlangs: any bizarre features of a natlang are natural by definition, but the same features in a conlang would have to persuade on their own merits. His case in point is , a natlang with no way of expressing time; no way of counting; a culture with no storytelling, oral history, or art; it can be spoken, whistled, hummed, or drummed; and it has different phonologies for men and women. If it were a conlang instead of a natlang, its creator would have a hard time passing it off as naturalistic.
